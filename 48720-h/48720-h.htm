<p class="tb">That the young girls for whom it is written may see
in &ldquo;Brenda&rsquo;s Cousin&rdquo; a clear picture of Radcliffe
College undergraduate life is the sincere wish of the
author, who hopes also that her fellow-graduates may
overlook the one or two slight anachronisms necessary
to a contemporary picture.</p>

<h1 title="">BRENDA&rsquo;S COUSIN AT RADCLIFFE</h1>
<h2 id="c1">I
<br /><span class="small">NEW ACQUAINTANCES</span></h2>
<p>A drop of ink splashed on the cover of Julia Bourne&rsquo;s
blue-book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon, I wasn&rsquo;t thinking,&rdquo; murmured
an apologetic voice, as Julia glanced up in surprise.
A small, pale girl standing beside her desk had evidently
held her fountain pen point down with disastrous result.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it did no great harm,&rdquo; responded Julia, dexterously
applying her blotter. Like the other girl, she
spoke in an undertone, for silence was still the rule of
the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thankful, however, that my book was closed,&rdquo;
she said to herself, as the other passed on. &ldquo;A blot on
an inner page might prejudice the examiner, and I shall
need all his good-will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the Tuesday before the opening of college, and
examinations were going on to enable some students to
take off conditions imposed by the June finals, or to permit
others&mdash;like Julia&mdash;to anticipate some study of the
Freshman year.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>Before handing in her book Julia corrected some errors,
for there still lacked ten minutes of the close of the examination
hour. As she sat there reading the printed
questions, one by one, she was thankful for the cool day.
How insufferably hot had been those two Junes when she
had taken her preliminaries and her finals! Old Fay
House then had swarmed with girls, lively, solemn,
silent, chattering, short, tall, thin, stout, dowdy, attractive,&mdash;but
why enumerate? They were as varied in
aspect, and probably in disposition, as those other girls
who never think of college. In comparison with the
spring crowds, the girls to-day were but a handful.</p>
<p>Julia, glancing toward the window, caught a glimpse of
the yellowing elms of Garden Street, and a soft September
breeze blew across her cheek. Then her eye wandered
to the photograph over the old-fashioned mantle-piece, and
she thought that the class-room, except for its chairs and
desks, was like the sitting-room of a private house.</p>
<p>Julia handed in her book promptly, but some of the
others gave theirs up reluctantly, as if to say, &ldquo;Oh, for
ten minutes more, or even five minutes. It would make
all the difference in the world to me.&rdquo; One of these
girls, who was tall and strong-looking, with short, curling
hair, expressed her feelings emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; she said, as Julia and she left the room
together, &ldquo;how you got through so soon. You haven&rsquo;t
been writing for ten minutes. Why, if we had five hours
instead of two, I should still need an hour more. Weren&rsquo;t
you frightened to death at the preliminaries?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>&ldquo;I barely survived,&rdquo; replied Julia, entering into the
other&rsquo;s mood. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an art in taking examinations
that I&rsquo;m only beginning to learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the worst is over! Harvard, they say (and of
course it&rsquo;s the same with Radcliffe), is the hardest college
to enter and the easiest to graduate from. That&rsquo;s why I
left my happy Western home. I don&rsquo;t mind struggling to
get in, but I want an easy time after I&rsquo;ve once entered
college.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re from the West?&rdquo; queried Julia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, from &lsquo;the wild and woolly West&rsquo; as you call
it here. I took my preliminaries in Chicago, although
my home&rsquo;s farther off. Our colleges are just as good as
any East, at least Pa says so. But I said &lsquo;the best isn&rsquo;t
too good for me, and if Harvard&rsquo;s the best of all for men,
why Radcliffe must be the best for women.&rsquo; As soon as
I&rsquo;d thought it out I made up my mind to come here. I
couldn&rsquo;t have done better, could I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Radcliffe has a pretty good standing in this part
of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t speak with enthusiasm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I was only thinking that a good education can be
obtained in a Western college. I&rsquo;ve lived in the West
myself,&rdquo; she explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me embrace you,&rdquo; cried the Western girl, impulsively,
fortunately without suiting the action to the word.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see it makes me tired the way people here pretend
not to know anything about the West; but I honestly
believe that you realize where Kansas is, and that St.
Louis and Chicago are a few miles apart, and that the
Mississippi is east of the Rocky Mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you could probably give me points in Western
geography.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, but let me introduce myself. My name is
Clarissa Herter, and my home is Kansas. My age is a
little more than it ought to be&mdash;for a Freshman&mdash;for
I&rsquo;ve wasted a year at college elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia smiled at this frank inventory, and she felt that
she could do no less than tell Clarissa something about
herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re an orphan!&rdquo; cried Clarissa, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ve
lived with relatives for two years or more. Well, you
must have had a pretty good disposition to stand all the
wear and tear. There&rsquo;s nothing so hard as living with
relatives&mdash;except one&rsquo;s parents. As to your personal
appearance, it suits me right down to the ground&mdash;don&rsquo;t
look at your boots,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;I include them in the
list.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then a proctor approaching introduced to the two
the timid girl who had blotted Julia&rsquo;s book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked for the introduction,&rdquo; said the newcomer,
whose name was Northcote, &ldquo;because I wished to apologize
for my carelessness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, really,&rdquo; responded Julia, &ldquo;the blot did no
harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if it had gone through the cover?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that would have been nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I fear that I did more mischief than you think.
There&rsquo;s a little ink spot on the side breadth of your skirt,
and I&rsquo;m sure that it came from my pen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Julia, looking where Pamela pointed, &ldquo;that
spot may have come from my own pen; and besides, the
gown has seen its best days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m very sorry,&rdquo; continued Miss Northcote.</p>
<p>In the meantime Clarissa had risen from the low, red
couch, on which they had been sitting. &ldquo;You must be a
New Englander.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m from Vermont.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; cried Clarissa. &ldquo;You have a well-developed
conscience. You seem to be apologizing for
something that perhaps you didn&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go upstairs to the library,&rdquo; interposed Julia,
noticing that Miss Northcote was made uncomfortable by
Clarissa&rsquo;s badinage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it pleasant! I had no idea it was so homelike!&rdquo;
exclaimed Julia on the threshold of the library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean you haven&rsquo;t been here before? Why,
I explored the whole building from top to bottom last
June. I didn&rsquo;t wait for a special invitation,&rdquo; cried
Clarissa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was so warm then!&rdquo; Julia felt almost bound to
apologize.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>The room that they had entered justified the term
&ldquo;homelike&rdquo; to the fullest extent. It had none of the
stiffness of a college hall, although shelves of books were
everywhere, always invitingly within reach. The deep-mullioned
windows, the high mantle-piece and broad fireplace
all had a decided charm. From the window that
Julia approached, through the elms that shaded Fay
House, there was a glimpse of the Soldiers&rsquo; Monument
on the Common, and nearer at hand the time-scarred
Washington Elm. After looking into one or two smaller
rooms filled with books, Clarissa suggested that they go
into the open air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be something of the gypsy in my blood,
for I begrudge every minute spent indoors at this season.
Clarissa! Clarissa!&rdquo; she cried dramatically, &ldquo;you must
out and walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your name Clarissa?&rdquo; asked the Vermont girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? Doesn&rsquo;t it suit me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; responded the other, &ldquo;for I am
called Pamela.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How odd! Why, people may begin to call us &lsquo;the
heroines,&rsquo; unless we show them that we&rsquo;re made of
stronger stuff than Richardson admired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Richardson! How he would be horrified to see
us modern girls going to college! You must belong to
sentimental families to have those names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was named for my aunt,&rdquo; explained Pamela with
dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m afraid that my mother took &lsquo;Clarissa&rsquo; from
a novel,&rdquo; admitted the Western girl.</p>
<p>After leaving Fay House, the two others walked with
Julia toward Brattle Street. They had gone but a short
distance when Clarissa exclaimed with surprise that it was
nearly one o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>&ldquo;My luncheon is at half-past one,&rdquo; said Julia, &ldquo;but
perhaps yours is earlier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, at my boarding-house we are very plebeian. At
one o&rsquo;clock we have dinner, not luncheon, while you, I
dare say, have dinner at half-past six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Julia, while Clarissa, echoing &ldquo;of
course,&rdquo; added, &ldquo;Then you must be a regular swell. But
I thought that I&rsquo;d feel better to find a boarding-place in
Cambridge, where their manners and customs are like ours
at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not to leave Pamela out of the conversation, Julia
asked her if she had found a boarding-place, and Pamela
replied that she had not yet decided on a house. She
might have added that all the rooms that thus far she had
seen were beyond her slender purse. Before they reached
Julia&rsquo;s door, Pamela bade the others good-bye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s almost too good, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; was Clarissa&rsquo;s
comment as Pamela disappeared in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like her,&rdquo; returned Julia, begging the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so do I; with that neat little figure, and those
melancholy gray eyes, she is my very idea of a Puritan
maiden. You are something like one yourself,&rdquo; she
concluded, &ldquo;and I hope that you&rsquo;ll let me call on you
occasionally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course, and I will call on you, too, if I may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus with the feeling that each had made a friend, the
two Freshmen parted, both looking forward with interest
to the college year.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>Julia went to Rockley that same Tuesday afternoon,
and was warmly welcomed by Brenda at the station. The
younger girl, it is true, teased her cousin about being a
Freshman, yet at the same time she showed so much
affection, despite her teasing, that she hardly seemed the
same Brenda who not long before had found in every act
of Julia&rsquo;s some cause for dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Rockley was the summer place of Mr. and Mrs. Robert
Barlow, the uncle and aunt with whom, for two years,
Julia Bourne had made her home. It was on the seashore,
little more than twenty miles from Boston, and
Julia had passed two happy vacations there. She had
gone to live with her uncle and aunt soon after her
father&rsquo;s death, and had completed her preparation for
college at Miss Crawdon&rsquo;s school, the same school that
Brenda and her intimate friends attended. Brenda,
Edith, Nora, and Belle were inseparables, while Julia had
been more intimate with Ruth Roberts, the Roxbury girl
who was now her room-mate at Cambridge.</p>
<p>The Barlows were to stay at Rockley until late October,
and Mrs. Barlow regretted that Julia must spend that
beautiful autumn month in Cambridge. She remarked at
dinner that Julia looked pale, and said that she and
Brenda had decided that this resulted from examinations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you can&rsquo;t imagine how weak <i>I</i> feel,&rdquo; Brenda had
added, &ldquo;after an examination. You know that Miss
Crawdon makes us have them, though few of us are going
to college.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>&ldquo;It pleases me,&rdquo; Mr. Barlow had interposed, &ldquo;that you
and your friends should get even this indirect advantage
from Radcliffe. In time the average private schoolgirl
may have an equal chance with boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, papa, you never have wished me to go to
college.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear, but I often have thought that you suffered
at school&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, papa, I <i>have</i> suffered at school, often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My idea of suffering probably differs from yours. I
mean that you suffer from a lack of thoroughness. Thoroughness
is the first essential of college preparation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, papa, girls can fit for college at Miss Crawdon&rsquo;s.
Julia and Ruth and several others prepared for
the examinations. But let us change the subject,&rdquo; said
Brenda, adding, &ldquo;What are those Radcliffe girls like?
Are they very queer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no indeed,&rdquo; replied Julia loyally. Yet even as
she spoke she had a vision of Pamela and Clarissa, to
whom Brenda might apply her adjective, although to each
in a different way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Barlow, &ldquo;thirty-five years
ago who would have imagined girls in college? Why,
even twenty years ago a man would have been thought
foolish to prophesy that within his lifetime girls would
be admitted to full Harvard privileges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but papa, it isn&rsquo;t really the same as Harvard.
The boys say that it is quite different.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s a difference without much distinction.
Professor Dummer the other day told me that Harvard
and Radcliffe students have identical examinations in all
subjects, as well as the same courses of study. But I will
grant that in athletics and that kind of thing they haven&rsquo;t
the same chance as Harvard boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the long glass door was pushed open,
and Philip stood within the room. The whole family
greeted him heartily, for they had not seen him since his
return from Europe. He told them that his mother and
Edith had decided to stay a month longer abroad, and that
he was spending a day or two on his yacht in Marblehead
Harbor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Thursday I must be in Cambridge, and after that
the &lsquo;Balloon&rsquo; goes out of commission for the season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young people soon went out on the piazza, where
they made themselves comfortable with cushions and
wraps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great thing to be young,&rdquo; said Mr. Barlow, as
their laughter rippled through the open window. Two
girls from a neighboring cottage had joined them, and
with them was their brother, also a Harvard undergraduate.
They had more in common with Brenda than with
Julia, and thus the latter was free to answer Philip&rsquo;s
many questions about Radcliffe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>Although two or three years Julia&rsquo;s senior, Philip had
of late acquired the habit of turning to her for advice.
To himself he admitted that her level-headedness had
more than once saved him from making a fool of himself.
Philip Blair had just escaped being spoiled after the
fashion of most only sons with plenty of money. His
parents had always been so ready to consider his wishes
that he had come to think the quick gratification of his
tastes a necessity. Because he was good-looking and
had agreeable manners, older men and women were apt to
flatter him, and his schoolmates fed his vanity in their
eagerness for his friendship. Without being really weak,
Philip was easily influenced; and though in school he
never had been in disgrace, more than once he had been
near suspension from college. A certain indolence made
it hard to shake off his undesirable associates. But even
the slow-thinking Edith had discovered that Philip had a
real regard for Julia&rsquo;s opinion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma and I are very glad that Philip likes to talk
to a sensible girl like Julia, for we were afraid that his
head might be turned, with so many silly girls always
running after him.&rdquo; Philip&rsquo;s college friends&mdash;those
whom he asked to dine with him sometimes, or took to
call on Edith&rsquo;s friends&mdash;were afraid of Julia.</p>
<p>Hearing that she was fitted for college, they could not
understand how Philip had the courage to talk with her,
or even to dance with her. They supposed that he was
polite to her simply because she was a friend of Edith&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;Not that she isn&rsquo;t a nice-looking girl, but she must be
frightfully strong-minded to think of going to college.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Knowing the Harvard sentiment toward Radcliffe,
therefore, Julia was prepared for more or less teasing
from Philip, and yet as she bade him good-bye she was
pleased to be able to remind him that he had said hardly
a thing to discourage her about her college career.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<h2 id="c2">II
<br /><span class="small">THE FRESHMAN RECEPTION</span></h2>
<p>When Julia approached Fay House on Thursday, the
opening of the term, there were girls on the steps, girls
in the halls, girls besieging the Secretary&rsquo;s office with
questions; old students stood about discussing all kinds of
things, from their summer experiences to their proposed
courses of study. But the Freshmen were less often in
groups. In single file they waited their turn at the office,
or sat in the conversation room, catching scraps of wisdom
from the lips of the older girls who passed by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, last year I had five and a half courses, but I&rsquo;ve
promised papa to be more sensible and limit myself to
four, so as to have some time for other things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This from a serious-looking girl, and then from another
more frivolous, &ldquo;Well, I tried to forget everything this
summer, except how to have a good time. It was delightful
not to have even a theme or a forensic on my mind.
I was a walking encyclopedia last June, but now I feel
absolutely empty-headed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world,&rdquo; came from another group, &ldquo;possessed
you to take Pol. Econ. this year? I thought you
were trying for honors in classics.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;So I am,&rdquo; in a rather melancholy tone; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m tired
of having nothing but Greek and Latin. My future bread
and butter may depend on them, as I&rsquo;m to be a teacher
of the classics, but I&rsquo;m indulging in Pol. Econ. as a
luxury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A luxury! Well, you&rsquo;ll pay for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia, seated at the reading table, was not only amused
by these bits of conversation, but was interested in watching
the passing girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it great?&rdquo; cried Ruth, joining her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
little like the first day at school, and yet it&rsquo;s different.
Who is that queer-looking girl, she&rsquo;s actually bowing to
you,&rdquo; with an intonation of disapproval; &ldquo;why, you don&rsquo;t
know her, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I met her yesterday. She&rsquo;s a Freshman from
the West.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clarissa now reached them, grasping Julia&rsquo;s hand with
a hearty &ldquo;Well, I <i>am</i> glad to see you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you chosen your electives yet?&rdquo; asked Julia,
after a minute or two. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they bewildering?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the elective, I&rsquo;ve been told,&rdquo; responded
Clarissa, &ldquo;but the man who gives them that makes the
difference. The younger the instructor, the worse his
marks. He thinks that he shows his own importance by
making &lsquo;A&rsquo; and &lsquo;B&rsquo; marks few and far between. I&rsquo;m
going in for all the starred courses I can get, for then
there&rsquo;ll be more chance of my having real professors to
teach me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Ruth hurried Julia away from Clarissa to an appointment
with a history professor. He had wished to talk
with them before consenting to their entering his class.
He was pleased to find them so interested, adding, as he
gave his consent:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be prepared for hard work, as Freshmen are
rarely permitted to take this course. I hope that you
read Latin at sight, for you may have to make researches
in some old books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he bowed and left them, and Ruth looked at
Julia, and the latter, understanding the question that
Ruth would ask, replied, &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll help you;&rdquo;
while Ruth, whose Latin was weaker than Julia&rsquo;s, responded,
&ldquo;You always were a dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia and Ruth had arranged to board in the same
house, having separate bedrooms, but sharing a large
study. This was a square, corner room, with three windows.
One looked down on a bit of old-fashioned garden,
and the other two gave a view of some of the stately
houses on Brattle Street. Their landlady, or hostess, as
she liked to be called, was the widow of a Harvard
instructor, who, besides a widow and two children, had
left a slim little book on the Greek accusative. Mrs.
Colton always had the book in plain sight on her library
table, and she believed that had her husband lived he
would have been one of the most distinguished of the
faculty. She had long refused to open her house to
Annex, or Radcliffe, students. Like many other conservative
people, she did not approve of the presence of
women students in Cambridge, and she did not care to
encourage the new woman&rsquo;s college by taking its students
to board. But when the new Harvard dormitories made
it harder for her to get the right kind of students to take
her rooms, she began to think about the possibilities of
Radcliffe. When she happened to hear that Mrs. Robert
Barlow was looking for a home for her niece, she immediately
sent word that she would be very glad to have her
consider her rooms. She saw that it would give her
house prestige to have Julia and Ruth her first Radcliffe
boarders. Mrs. Barlow and the girls were well pleased
with the rooms, especially as Mrs. Colton was to take no
other boarders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Ruth and Julia would hardly have been girls, however,
had they been perfectly satisfied with the arrangement of
the furniture as planned by Mrs. Colton and Mrs. Barlow.
With the exception of a few pictures, the study was supposed
to be in perfect order on that first Thursday of
the term. But Julia, when they went upstairs after
luncheon, decided that the divan must be moved from
the windows to the corner opposite the fireplace, and
Ruth suggested that the library table should go from the
centre to a recess near the mantle-piece. Chairs ranged
stiffly against the wall they pulled out into more inviting
positions, and moved many other things. They both
agreed that several pictures must be rehung, and Ruth
began to jump about from mantle-piece to table to make
the changes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do be careful!&rdquo; cried Julia, as Ruth stepped from
a chair to the table, with a framed Braun photograph
under her arm, and a half-dozen picture nails in her hand.
&ldquo;Do wait,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;until we can find some one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait for whom? We can&rsquo;t call the chambermaid, and
Mrs. Colton would be of no more use than&mdash;well, than
you, Julia. Besides, I&rsquo;ve hung more pictures than you
could count; and&mdash;why, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; she concluded,
as a very loud knocking at the door sounded through the
rooms. Forgetting the picture under her arm, as she
turned she let it fall with a crash to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious!&rdquo; cried Master Percival Colton, astonished
at the sight of one Radcliffe girl standing on a narrow
mantle-piece with another sitting on the floor picking up
fragments of broken glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope nothing&rsquo;s hurt,&rdquo; said Percival politely, though
hardly concealing his curiosity as he handed Julia two
letters. Then he turned away rather sadly, as the girls
neither explained what had happened nor what they intended
to do about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come down, Ruth,&rdquo; cried Julia, as Percy disappeared.
&ldquo;Clarissa Herter, that Kansas girl, has sent her card with
these letters that she found on the bulletin board. She
thought that we might like to have them. Oh, they&rsquo;re
invitations!&rdquo; she added, as she opened her envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Senior, Junior, and Sophomore classes at home in
the Auditorium, Saturday, September 30.<span class="hst"> 4 to 6.&rdquo;</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our first college invitation, and from the upper
classes, too! Well, it&rsquo;s evident that they don&rsquo;t intend to
haze us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Hardly had Julia and Ruth stepped into the Auditorium
that Saturday afternoon when a girl with a ribbon badge
greeted them warmly. From a table near the door she
took two slips of paper, and, pinning one on Julia&rsquo;s dress,
said pleasantly, &ldquo;You must excuse my being so unceremonious,
but we find that this is the best way of making
girls acquainted with one another, by giving them slips of
paper with their names written on them. I honestly think
that you feel more like talking to a girl if you know
her name. Your slips are white, but we old girls wear
blue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you know which slips of paper to give
us?&rdquo; asked Ruth, as she received a decoration like
Julia&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I was interested, that is, I asked particularly who
you were the other day,&rdquo; replied the older girl in a flattering
tone. &ldquo;But now I must find your Senior for you,&rdquo;
she concluded; &ldquo;perhaps you haven&rsquo;t met her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Senior?&rdquo; asked Julia. &ldquo;Why, how in the world
do I happen to have one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, then, until I find her. She will tell you
all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon Julia found herself standing before a tall, plain
girl with glasses, who wore her Senior&rsquo;s gown ungracefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is your Senior adviser, Miss Townall, Miss
Bourne. I am sure that you will like each other;&rdquo; and
the vivacious usher, asking Ruth to accompany her,
turned away to find Ruth&rsquo;s Senior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Darcy is always bright and cheerful,&rdquo; said Miss
Townall, making an effort to talk to Julia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, I like her immensely. She&rsquo;s a Sophomore,
I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and very popular.&rdquo; Jane looked at Julia, as if
at an utter loss for a subject of conversation, until Julia
asked her to explain the system of assigning Senior
adviser. In giving information Jane waxed eloquent,
and explained that the Emmanuel Society made the arrangements,
bringing it about that each Senior should
take charge of one Freshman, holding herself ready to
give her any needed advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of them have two,&rdquo; added Ruth, who had
rejoined them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, naturally, for there are always more Freshmen
than Seniors; but dear me, it&rsquo;s bad enough to have one on
your mind,&rdquo; said Jane tactlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, I didn&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; she apologized, at once
conscious of her own awkwardness. &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m
delighted to be of help to any Freshman, but there is so
much danger of giving the wrong advice, and&mdash;&rdquo; so Jane
went on explaining and explaining, as people are apt to
when once they have made a mistake, without greatly
improving the state of affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where is your Senior, Ruth?&rdquo; asked Julia, to put
Jane more at ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I left her talking to that Western girl. She
seemed so deeply interested in her that I thought I might
be in the way. We have been introduced, however, and
if she wishes to speak to me again, she may take the
trouble to find me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Julia wondered if Ruth&rsquo;s annoyance had come from
anything said or done by Clarissa. Already she had seen
that Ruth did not like the Western girl.</p>
<p>As the rooms began to fill with girls, Julia and Ruth
recognized many whom they had seen at examination
time, and among them a number from their own classes.
Coffee and chocolate and sherbets were served from small
tables, and the girls who served and the ushers who
helped them were kept busy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not sherbet, but college ice,&rdquo; corrected a girl at one
of the tables. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll grow heartily sick of it in the
next four years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Clarissa, to whom she spoke, replied, &ldquo;Oh, a rose
by any other name would smell as sweet; and therefore, as
a Freshman I&rsquo;ll ask for another glass. I suppose that our
class will never again be as important as now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably never again at Radcliffe, at least until the
end of your Senior year. We take the Freshmen up
tenderly, treat them very kindly on the first Saturday of
the term, and then drop them suddenly. Unless a Freshman
shows unusual ability, we are apt to forget all about
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll see what I can do to make myself remembered,&rdquo;
retorted Clarissa, as if accepting a challenge.</p>
<p>In the meantime Julia and Ruth had again run across
Miss Darcy, and the latter had inquired if it would be
an unheard-of thing for her to change her Freshman
adviser.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can do it, of course. It has been done occasionally,
but if I were you I&rsquo;d wait. So few girls do make
a change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear that you think me notional.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; responded Miss Darcy. &ldquo;I feel that you are
going to be&mdash;that is, that you <i>are</i>&mdash;the typical Radcliffe
girl, and that naturally means everything agreeable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, if we may judge by those who are here
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! we are in holiday attire now, but you will like us
even at our worst.&rdquo; And Julia and Ruth, looking about
them, agreed that Radcliffe in holiday attire was well
worth seeing. The rooms were prettily decorated, and
most of the girls wore light and becoming colors. There
was little formality, and each girl was not only at liberty
to speak to her neighbor, but was sure to be met more
than halfway.</p>
<p>Finally, before they separated, the Glee Club girls
gathered around the grand piano, and one merry song
after another was sung, to the great delight of the Freshmen.
One that made the most impression was &ldquo;The
Only Man,&rdquo; which, although unfamiliar to many of the
new girls, was already counted a classic of its kind. Even
Jane Townall had been known to laugh at its merry
strains.</p>
<p>The song told of a young man who was invited to a
Radcliffe tea, who, when he reached Fay House, saw only
women in sight:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The poor young man stood trembling there,</p>
<p class="t0">And looked about for aid,</p>
<p class="t0">He&rsquo;d never been afraid before,</p>
<p class="t0">But now he was afraid.</p>
<p class="t0">He gave one long, last lingering look,</p>
<p class="t0">Then rushed out at the door.</p>
<p class="t0">I think that he&rsquo;ll think twice before</p>
<p class="t0">He comes here any more-ore-ore.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Now all you Harvard men attend!</p>
<p class="t0">If ever you get a bid</p>
<p class="t0">To a Radcliffe tea, be sure and see</p>
<p class="t0">If any others did.</p>
<p class="t0">Do you think that you could face the fate,</p>
<p class="t0">From which our hero ran,</p>
<p class="t0">Among four hundred Radcliffe girls,</p>
<p class="t0">To be the only man-an-an?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>There were several other stanzas, and as the hero was
described as a particularly brave athlete, the refrain following
each stanza was particularly entertaining, for it went
somewhat in this fashion:</p>
<div class="verse">

<h2 id="c3">III
<br /><span class="small">THE FIRST &ldquo;IDLER&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to the Idler?&rdquo; cried Clarissa one morning
to a group around the bulletin board.</p>
<p>Then a little Freshman spoke up timidly, &ldquo;Why, can
any of us go? I thought that it was a club meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the Idler is the only unexclusive institution that
I&rsquo;ve struck in this part of the world. Just sign the
constitution and you&rsquo;re in it for life. Come, you must
join; we must make our class felt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pressing nearer the board, one of the group read aloud
that all Radcliffe students, regular or special, were invited
to a meeting of the Idler Club on Friday afternoon
at half-past four in the Auditorium.</p>
<p>Accordingly, they were all in their places before the
appointed hour. The Auditorium was overflowing, and
some girls even had chairs in the aisles. Ruth and Julia
leaned on the ledge of the window opening from the conversation
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they begin?&rdquo; asked Ruth impatiently, at
quarter of five. But even as she spoke there was a lull
in the conversation, and a rather commanding figure rose
on the platform.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is the President of the Idler,&rdquo; whispered Ruth,
&ldquo;Mary Witherspoon. I had her pointed out to me the
other day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Witherspoon made an address that was clear and
to the point. She congratulated the old students on the
prospect of a successful year for the Idler; she welcomed
the new students very heartily, and expressed the hope
that all present would at the close of the meeting enroll
themselves on the Idler&rsquo;s membership list. She alluded
to the fact that nothing was imposed on them beyond
signing the club&rsquo;s very simple constitution and paying
the small annual dues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope, however, that all Radcliffe girls who can do
anything to entertain us, who are willing to act or sing,
or even write plays, will speak with me or with some of
the Idler officers on the subject. We cannot afford to let
any talent lie hidden; and if a girl is too modest to let us
know what she can do, some one else will be sure to tell
us, and then we shall be obliged to issue some kind of a
mandamus to compel her to be amusing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All laughed at this, and when quiet was restored Miss
Witherspoon announced as the entertainment of the
afternoon a farce written by two Idler members, who for
the present preferred to be anonymous. Thereupon the
curtain rose on a pretty stage set for a drawing-room
scene. In the background were two tall plants and
a bookcase and a fine water-color on an easel; in the
foreground a tea-table, daintily spread, and beside it two
young girls drinking tea, and discussing the advantages
and disadvantages of a college education.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>It was clear as the dialogue proceeded why the authors
wished to be anonymous; for there were many local
hits, and the applause showed that the audience recognized
the college types depicted. The college partisan
also created much amusement by describing the homeless
creature constantly roaming the world in search of
culture.</p>
<p>Julia and Ruth, moving about after the play, saw many
of the ushers of the Freshman reception. Now, as then,
Elizabeth Darcy was one of the most conspicuous. The
refreshments served were very simple,&mdash;a punch bowl
filled with lemonade stood on a table in the conversation
room, surrounded by plates of cakes.</p>
<p>Ruth was soon seized by some of her own special
friends, and Julia wandered over toward the Garden
Street windows. She probably would not have noticed
the girl sitting in a corner behind the periodical case had
not a nervous voice exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, I am so glad to see
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she recognized Pamela, Julia felt a pang of conscience.
Absorbed in her own affairs, she had hardly
remembered the Vermont girl. Now she greeted her
most cordially, and as Pamela came out of her corner she
saw that her face as well as her clothes had a dejected
expression. Her dull-brown hair was brushed back
tightly, her linen collar was fastened with an old-fashioned
brooch. There was no useless furbelow about her
non-descript grayish gown, and she wore an expression to
match her attire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>But Pamela brightened as Julia held her hand. &ldquo;Oh,
I&rsquo;m so glad to see you,&rdquo; she repeated; &ldquo;I have been very
lonely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lonely! with all these girls about you?&rdquo; and Julia
glanced toward the girls swarming over the lemonade
table, and toward the hall where there were still girls, and
girls, and girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m lonely because there <i>are</i> so many girls here,&rdquo;
responded Pamela. &ldquo;I know so few, and every one else
seems to have a special friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Julia felt that twinge of conscience. She herself
had not been altogether guiltless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I am your friend, and I&rsquo;m going to call on you
at once, and you must come to see us some Monday soon.
We are to be at home Mondays after four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This cordial invitation was cordially accepted, but Julia
noticed that Pamela did not give her own address.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know every one,&rdquo; the latter exclaimed, as she and
Julia walked toward the Auditorium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, between us Ruth and I have met most of our
class. But you ought to know them, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I never dare speak first to a girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you ought not to feel timid in the presence of
mere Freshmen, like yourself or myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never can make up my mind to speak to them. I
don&rsquo;t see how I ever dared speak to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A drop of ink, don&rsquo;t you remember? That did it&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course it was my duty to apologize.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, just spill a glass of lemonade over one or
two of those pretty gowns, and you&rsquo;ll be justified in
speaking to the wearers of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though Pamela wondered if Julia was quizzing her she
was not offended. Julia, realizing that Pamela was more
serious than most Freshmen, thought that she might
enjoy meeting some of the older and more studious girls.
Looking around to see whom among them she could introduce
to her, she quickly saw Elizabeth Darcy. But
Elizabeth was a conscientious usher, and as soon as she
had attended to the wants of one girl she flew toward
another. Her eye fell on Julia just when the latter, after
following her across the room, had half despaired of a
chance to speak to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, Miss Bourne,&rdquo; she said, holding out
her hand. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you let me get you something, lemonade
or chocolate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you,&rdquo; responded Julia, &ldquo;but I wish to ask
a favor. May I not introduce you to a Freshman who
has not many friends? She is near the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth glanced toward Pamela, standing in a limp
and uninteresting attitude. Her quick eye undoubtedly
noted every detail of clothes that showed unmistakably
the stamp of the country dressmaker.</p>
<p>Elizabeth smiled sweetly, as she would have smiled
under even more trying circumstances.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am ever so sorry, but I am frightfully busy this
afternoon. Some other time, Miss Bourne, but now I
could not give a minute to your&mdash;your friend; and besides,
I haven&rsquo;t time for any new girl unless I should
happen to take a very great fancy to her as I have to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of the touch of this flattery, Julia justly felt
annoyed with Elizabeth. &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; she reflected,
&ldquo;ushers ought to make themselves as agreeable as possible
to all Freshmen, and it isn&rsquo;t quite right for one of them
to decline an introduction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth had hastened off with polite excuses, and
Julia saw her join a group of lively girls at the other side
of the room. &ldquo;She is not working very hard now,&rdquo; she
thought, moving toward Pamela. She had gone only a
few steps when a rather shrill voice called her by name.
Turning, she recognized a bright little Southerner who sat
near her in English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you bound? You look like you had something
on your mind,&rdquo; cried the Southerner, whose name,
Julia vaguely remembered, was Porson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I have a fellow Freshman on my hands; she
knows hardly any one, and I would like to introduce her,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am at your service if you think that I will fill
in the blank. You know this is my second year, though my
first as a Freshman, and I always like to meet new girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, thank you,&rdquo; responded Julia, &ldquo;I should be delighted.
She is in English &lsquo;A,&rsquo; too, so you will have
one bond of interest with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pamela was still standing where Julia had left her, but
as the two girls approached she held out her hand with a
&ldquo;Good-bye&rdquo; to Julia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;I must go now, it is past five o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is early,&rdquo; responded Julia. &ldquo;I wish that
you could stay longer, for I have brought Miss Porson to
meet you. She is in our English class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But even after the introduction Pamela would not
linger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really must go,&rdquo; she said nervously. &ldquo;It is past
five o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you speak like Cinderella,&rdquo; cried Miss Porson
gaily; &ldquo;she had to go home at some unheard-of early
hour&mdash;or was it a late hour? At any rate, nobody ought
to be a slave to time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little Southerner with her allusion to Cinderella did
not know how nearly she hit the truth. But Pamela,
unduly sensitive, winced at the comparison. After bidding
the two good-bye, she hastened up North Avenue
toward Miss Batson&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she a little&mdash;just a little odd?&rdquo; inquired Miss
Porson, after Pamela had gone away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot say,&rdquo; responded Julia, &ldquo;I know her so
slightly. I ran across her a day or two before college
opened, and in some way I feel drawn toward her, although
I have seen little of her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<h2 id="c4">IV
<br /><span class="small">PAMELA&rsquo;S PERSEVERANCE</span></h2>
<p>When Pamela Northcote first found herself in Cambridge
it seemed, as the children say, &ldquo;too good to be
true.&rdquo; It had long been her dream to study some day
under Harvard professors, but in this world dreams so
seldom are realized that she was genuinely surprised that
her dream had come to pass. Yet Pamela herself had been
her own fairy godmother, and to her own efforts she owed
her appearance at Radcliffe.</p>
<p>Pamela had been but a little girl when women first
began to study at Cambridge. Even then she made up
her mind that if she could she would sometime be an
Annex student. The road had been a hard one, but here
she was. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth all I&rsquo;ve been through to come
here, worth it all.&rdquo; Yet she sighed, thinking of her difficulties
in getting enough money to warrant her entering
Radcliffe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Pamela had been early left an orphan, and an uncle and
aunt had given her a home, if not grudgingly, at least not
always cheerfully. They did what they could for her
physical comfort, but they would not encourage her in
her desire to go to college; and had they been willing to
encourage her, they could not have helped her. They
had no money to spare for superfluous things, and a
college education&mdash;at least for a woman&mdash;was certainly
a superfluity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>That she should go to college had seemed to Pamela a
filial duty. Her father, whom she remembered but dimly,
had worked his way through a small New England college
and later through the Harvard Divinity School. In a
trunk of old letters Pamela had found one of her father&rsquo;s
written to her mother when Pamela was a baby. &ldquo;If our
boy had lived I should count no sacrifice too great that
would enable me to send him to college.&rdquo; A diary of her
father&rsquo;s in the same trunk showed Pamela how prayerfully
he had dedicated his baby boy to the ministry. But the
boy had lived only a year, and Pamela knew that he felt
this loss keenly. &ldquo;If my father had lived he would have
wished me to go to college; he would have had me study
with him until I was ready. It is my duty to make
the most of myself, to be as nearly as I can like what
his son might have been.&rdquo; So Pamela worked and struggled
to get a little money together for her college education.
Although her desire for a Harvard course seemed
presumptuous, Cambridge was her goal. There was a
good academy in the town where she lived, and this
simplified her preparation. In the vacations she taught
a country school, and she decided that when she had
three hundred dollars she would venture it all on a year
at Cambridge,&mdash;provided, of course, that she could pass
the examinations. Now it happened that the very year in
which she was to be graduated from the academy, a prize
was offered by a rich townswoman to be awarded to the
student, boy or girl, in the Classical Department who
should pass the best examination. Pamela wore herself
almost to a shadow studying. She won the prize, a
scholarship of two hundred dollars, given on the condition
that the winner should spend the money on a college
course. Colleges were recommended to Pamela in which
this sum would have paid almost the whole cost of tuition
and board, but the young girl would have none of these.
She saw in the winning of the prize a dispensation that
she was to attain her long-cherished hope of going to
Cambridge. She passed most of her entrance examinations
that spring, drawing somewhat on her slender
capital for the journey to Boston, and in September she
passed the remainder. On entering Radcliffe, therefore,
her assets consisted of three honors from the examinations
and three hundred dollars in money. Two-thirds of
this money was the academy prize and one-third was her
savings of several years. The brain that she had inherited
from her father and the courage that had come to
her from her mother were not backed by great physical
strength. She was stronger, however, than she looked,
and she did not fear her course at Radcliffe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Yet Radcliffe does not offer unalloyed bliss even to a
girl as earnest as Pamela, if she has to cogitate too long
on the best way of making both ends meet. Out of her
three hundred dollars Pamela knew that she must spend
two hundred dollars for tuition, and she wondered how
she was to make one hundred dollars cover board, lodgings,
and incidentals for the year. She made no account
of clothes, as she did not intend to add to her slender
wardrobe for another twelve months. Half of her tuition
would not be due until February, and if worse came to
worse she thought that she might draw on her tuition
money for her board of the first half-year. Yet this was
a resource only if everything else failed. She felt that if
she could carry herself through the first half-year, some
way of earning the money to make up the deficit would
present itself in the second half-year.</p>
<p>The day before college opened Pamela went to see an
elderly woman who had been a friend of her mother&rsquo;s who
kept a small millinery shop in one of the northern suburbs
of Boston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I admire your spirit,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dorkins when Pamela
had described her efforts to find a cheap boarding-place.
&ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d have a hard time to find a place you could
afford; and if you won&rsquo;t be offended, I&rsquo;ll tell you how you
might be comfortable without its costing you much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I be offended, Mrs. Dorkins? I know
that you wouldn&rsquo;t propose anything that wasn&rsquo;t right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, a thing may be right without being exactly
what you&rsquo;d like. I can&rsquo;t forget that your father was my
minister; and when I remember what a good man he was
it seems&rsquo;s if you ought to have everything you want and
not humble yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t told me, Mrs. Dorkins, what it is
that you have in mind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, a cousin of my late husband&rsquo;s lives in North
Cambridge; she takes young women lodgers, who get
their breakfast with her and their tea. They have dinner
in the City in the middle of the day, for they are all of
them employed&mdash;bookkeepers, or sales-ladies, or something
of that kind. There&rsquo;s only four or five and
they&rsquo;re real nice girls, and steady pay, though they can&rsquo;t
afford big prices. Now she wants some one to help her
with her work&mdash;my cousin does. Not a regular servant,
for she does the cooking and hard work herself. But
she&rsquo;d like some one to set the table and wait on them
morning and evening a little. She said that if she could
get some one that didn&rsquo;t want much pay, she&rsquo;d give them
a good home, and they could have all the day to themselves
and most of the evenings. Now Pamela, if you
was willing to do this you wouldn&rsquo;t have to pay board
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pamela&rsquo;s heart beat violently while Mrs. Dorkins
talked. This was just the kind of thing she wanted.
Her subconsciousness immediately set down as wrong
the feeling of pride which at first threatened to stand in
the way of her accepting it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Dorkins, you are very kind; that is really
the kind of thing I have been looking for, only&mdash;only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know just how you feel, Pamela, but remember
what Holy Writ says about pride. Not that I don&rsquo;t
think you&rsquo;ve a right to feel as you do. Your father was
a perfect gentleman, though he never had much money,
and was born at Bearfield where I was born, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it really isn&rsquo;t that, Mrs. Dorkins, it really isn&rsquo;t
pride,&rdquo; and Pamela meant what she said. &ldquo;Only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said the practical Mrs. Dorkins, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
go over to Cambridge to-morrow and take you to Miss
Batson&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll suit, and I hope that you&rsquo;ll
like her. She has a neat little place, and she&rsquo;ll treat you
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It happened, therefore, that on the very day after the
opening of college Pamela found herself moving her possessions
to Miss Batson&rsquo;s French-roof cottage. She was
to do certain work in consideration of room and board,
and she was to have a fair amount of time to herself.
Miss Batson did not offer her, nor did she desire, any
money payment for her services. Indeed, she considered
herself almost rich. She had room and board provided
for her for the year, and after paying her tuition fees of
two hundred dollars she would have one hundred dollars
left for books, clothes, and incidentals. This to her
seemed a very large sum.</p>
<p>Yet there was one thing that troubled her. She would
have liked a room to herself, and she found it hard instead
to regard as a bedroom the sofa-bed in Miss Batson&rsquo;s little
plush-trimmed parlor. But in a few days she became
fairly contented with this arrangement, and toward nine
o&rsquo;clock each evening would close the folding-doors so that
she might go to bed without disturbing Miss Batson&rsquo;s
boarders, who often entertained visitors in the little front
room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>For her study she had a corner of the dining-room
table; and though her work was often interrupted by
questions and comments from Miss Batson, who would
look in upon her occasionally, she still reflected that she
might have been much worse off. Yet sometimes she
sincerely pitied herself. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t exactly pleasant to be
living in a house without a single corner that I can call
my own. I can never invite any one here to see me. For
although Miss Batson is very kind, I know that she regards
me as &lsquo;help,&rsquo; a refined species of &lsquo;help&rsquo; to be sure,
but still only &lsquo;help.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had felt strongly drawn to Julia Bourne, and she
hoped that she might be able to see much more of her.
Yet she reddened as she thought of Julia in much the
same way that she reddened whenever the subject of her
boarding-place came up. Although she was a minister&rsquo;s
daughter, although she realized the sin as well as the
folly of false pride, she yet felt uncomfortable whenever
she reflected that to the unprejudiced observer, indeed to
any one except Mrs. Dorkins, she might seem to be only
Miss Batson&rsquo;s &ldquo;help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Batson&rsquo;s boarders could not understand her.
They were young women who earned fairly good pay, as
expert bookkeepers or clerks. They knew that Pamela
was a student, and one or two of them were sorry that so
delicate a looking girl should be obliged both to work and
to study.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that the work is so hard,&rdquo; said the youngest
of the bookkeepers, &ldquo;but to think of a little thing like
her studying those great books. I&rsquo;ve noticed her coming
in in the evenings, and she&rsquo;s always loaded down with
books. Anybody&rsquo;d have to wear glasses if they spent all
their time looking into books. I wouldn&rsquo;t do it myself.
Why, it must be most as hard as school teaching, and I
always thought that that was dreadful.&rdquo; Yet Miss Batson&rsquo;s
young ladies (for in this way did their landlady
always speak of them) in spite of these occasional criticisms
were proud to have a college student living in the house.
They were inclined to be very friendly, and Pamela sometimes
reproached herself for keeping them at a distance.
Their well-meant familiarities annoyed her, and she found
it hard to conceal her feeling. In consequence she was
much lonelier at Miss Batson&rsquo;s than she need have been.</p>
<p>It was rather an understanding than an arrangement
that she should be at home in the afternoon in time to
help Miss Batson prepare her half-past six tea. This
meant that Pamela should be at home by half-past five;
and as she always walked home from the Square, she had
to leave Fay House by five o&rsquo;clock. There was really no
hardship in this, since all recitations were over by half-past
four. On the other hand, Pamela had decided that
to do her duty by Miss Batson she ought to refrain from
any part in the social life of the college, for she had
learned that nearly all the clubs and receptions were held
between half-past four o&rsquo;clock and six.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>It was on this account that she had given up the Freshman
reception. In spite of her Spartan resolve, Pamela
had just a little longing for the fun that certainly formed
a legitimate part of college life. Although she had had
more than her share of care, although of a more serious
temperament than many of her classmates, she was still
girl enough to see the possibility that Radcliffe offered
for social enjoyment. Yet with this perception came a
sense of her own lack of adaptability to people; instead
of attracting them, she felt that she rather repelled those
whom she met.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<h2 id="c5">V
<br /><span class="small">COLLEGE CALLERS</span></h2>
<p>One afternoon as Julia and Ruth were walking toward
Elmwood a human whirlwind stormed past them, composed,
as it seemed, chiefly of woollen sweaters and legs
in knee breeches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;what geese boys can make of
themselves! Actually, I think that I recognized Philip
among them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I believe he&rsquo;s in training.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad that he has something to do. But I
wonder that he and Will haven&rsquo;t called on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seeing us may remind them. I know that they have
been intending to call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia&rsquo;s surmise proved correct, and that very evening
the cards of the two Seniors were brought to them.
When Julia and Ruth went downstairs to see them,
Philip said in half apology:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve often wandered in this direction in our evening
strolls, but we have never had the courage to come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world made you so courageous tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; said Will, &ldquo;Philip came back to the
club after dinner with glowing accounts of you both. He
said that he could not see that you had changed a hair
since coming to Radcliffe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the name of common sense did he expect?&rdquo;
Ruth&rsquo;s voice had a note of indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we expected a great alteration. In the first
place, to be typical Radcliffe girls you ought to wear
glasses. Then I am sure that you ought to have had a
huge bundle of books under your arm, and your clothes&mdash;it
gets on my nerves to see the clothes most of the
Cambridge girls wear; I suppose they are Radcliffe girls.
But I could see that you looked as up-to-date as Edith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Philip, almost out of breath with the exertion of explaining
himself, was disconcerted by the laughter that
greeted his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is greatly to be feared,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;that the typical
Radcliffe girl would be as hard to find as the average
Harvard student. I haven&rsquo;t seen either of them yet.
But it&rsquo;s really too funny for you to have expected Julia
and me to develop our college peculiarities so soon. Give
us time and we may become typical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, of course now,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;I did not
expect to find you entirely changed, although you know
yourself that college might make a difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally we&rsquo;d rather not belong to the tiresome class
of persons who are always the same, yet we do not wish
our friends to find us altered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you were well enough before,&rdquo; and Will glanced
toward Ruth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you thought it best to let well enough alone?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, really you are severe! But not to dwell on
personalities&mdash;how do you like your rooms here? They
seem very domestic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are not our special rooms,&rdquo; explained Julia;
&ldquo;our study is upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When are we to see your study, or &lsquo;den,&rsquo; as I suppose
you will come to call it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that you would not think it typical enough
to be called a den.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when <i>are</i> we to see it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, later we&rsquo;ll give you a tea, with Aunt Anna or
Mrs. Blair to chaperon us. You&rsquo;ll have a chance then
to offer any amount of advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give you points that may be useful next year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! next year we&rsquo;ll be Sophomores, and Sophomores
know everything,&rdquo; retorted Julia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and sometimes more than everything. <i>We</i> did,
didn&rsquo;t we, Philip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say so! I&rsquo;ve never since been so wise as I
was in that Sophomore year. I&rsquo;d almost like to be a
Sophomore again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may have the chance,&rdquo; interposed Will, &ldquo;if you
drop down a class at a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Philip looked uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful, please; no twitting on facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On facts?&rdquo; queried Ruth. &ldquo;Is it as bad as that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the Faculty has a wretched habit of giving a fellow
warnings, especially at the beginning of the Senior
year, just to see how he will take them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Julia, &ldquo;I should take them as warnings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She saw by Philip&rsquo;s expression that there was more than
a mere suggestion of truth in what Will had said, and she
resolved at the first favorable opportunity to have a serious
talk with him. She remembered that the preceding year
he had spoken of one or two conditions to be worked off
before the close of his Senior year, and she began to fear
that he had neglected to do this. In spite of his little
affectations, Philip had a charm for Julia. At least she
felt a genuine interest in him, partly on his own account,
and partly because she was so fond of Edith. She hoped
that he would make more of himself than some of the
young men in his set had thought it worth while to make
of themselves.</p>
<p>While her thoughts were wandering, the conversation
of the other three went straight on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we only knew what you would like,&rdquo; Philip was
saying, &ldquo;we might give you something more substantial
than points for your room. I have a fine &lsquo;To Let&rsquo; sign
that was hung out originally somewhere down in the
&lsquo;Port.&rsquo; I haven&rsquo;t really room for it, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s only black and white. When you make a
present, you ought not to be mean,&rdquo; said Will. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the matter with that barber&rsquo;s pole that you cherish so
carefully in a corner of your room? I hear that its former
owner is still searching for it. A Radcliffe room would
really be a safer retreat for it than yours.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I wouldn&rsquo;t get these girls into trouble. If I
present them with anything it must be something ennobling,&mdash;a
tidy, or&mdash;or&mdash;a picture-scarf, or something of
that kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t a tidy in our room,&rdquo; interposed Ruth
triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it must have a very unfeminine appearance,&rdquo;
responded Philip. &ldquo;I am sorry that Radcliffe influences
are so hardening. It wasn&rsquo;t that way when you helped
in that Bazaar. Don&rsquo;t you remember what work I had to
find something suitable for a college room, and there was
nothing to be had but tidies, and dolls, and things like
that? Your minds were all feminine enough then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember that I found just what I wanted,&rdquo; said
Will, smiling at Ruth. &ldquo;A very beautiful sofa pillow,
with a crimson &lsquo;H&rsquo; embroidered upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As it was Ruth who had made this pillow for the
Bazaar given by the Four Club, and as Will had insisted
on buying it as soon as he learned that it was the work
of her hands, she naturally looked conscious at this
reminiscence.</p>
<p>Thus the conversation of the four young people flowed
on; and although the girls tried not to be too serious, they
really did glean some useful information from the two
Seniors. The gossip of undergraduates about professors,
their fancied insight into the methods of their instructors
is harmless enough. Yet critical listeners might have
questioned the correctness of some of the judgments so
glibly put forth by Philip and Will.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Philip, to tell the truth, was surprised to find himself
encouraging the girls in their college career by even these
scraps of information. He liked Julia so well that he
could not reconcile himself to her going to college.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is different,&rdquo; he had said to her magnificently one
day at Brenda&rsquo;s, &ldquo;it is different, of course, in the case of
a man. If he doesn&rsquo;t go to college he doesn&rsquo;t amount to
much. People think it&rsquo;s because he can&rsquo;t get in, and
that kind of thing. But for a girl, why you know that it
really hurts her in the opinion of most people if she goes
to college.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like his sister Edith, Philip was occasionally rather
tactless, although both had the best intentions in the
world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope that I won&rsquo;t be hurt, at least in the opinion of
my friends, by going to college,&rdquo; said Julia quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; rejoined Philip. &ldquo;I might feel that
way about some other girl, but not about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia accepted the apology, but she remembered the
incident. She thought of it again, as she sat before her
fire that evening, and then her thoughts travelled toward
Brenda. Brenda, too, had never really approved of
Julia&rsquo;s going to college.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was funny, although not exactly amusing,&rdquo; reflected
Julia, &ldquo;when she let Belle persuade her that it was an
affront to the family when I wished to study anything so
unconventional&mdash;for a girl&mdash;as Greek. Yet all&rsquo;s well
that ends well, and Brenda is so different now that I can
hardly believe that it is only two years since she was so
pettish and inconsiderate.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Yet although Brenda had certainly improved in the past
two years she was still as far from perfection as most
young girls of sixteen or seventeen. She was still impulsive,
and disinclined to receive advice. But remembering
her past mistakes, she was less ready than formerly
to find fault with Julia.</p>
<p>One thing that had brought the two girls together was
a common interest in a poor Portuguese family. The
helpless Rosas living at the North End had appealed very
strongly to Julia, and for a time she had feared that she
might not be able to do much for them, because Brenda
and her three most intimate friends had undertaken to
make the mother and children their especial prot&eacute;g&eacute;s.
At length Julia&rsquo;s opportunity had come, and she had not
only shared in the Bazaar by which &ldquo;The Four&rdquo; had
raised money for Mrs. Rosa, but she had also assisted in
moving the family from the North End to a healthier
home in the pretty village of Shiloh.</p>
<p>Since then the Rosas had apparently prospered, and
Julia could think of them with satisfaction. Her interest
in them had a double thread, for besides sympathizing
with their helplessness, she felt that but for the Rosas,
and the events connected with their removal to Shiloh,
she could hardly have had so complete an understanding
with Brenda.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Yet in her heart Julia realized that as they grew older
she and Brenda were likely to see less rather than more of
each other, their tastes were so very different. Brenda
had still a year more of school before her, and when that
was completed she would enter society. For a few years
life would be a whirl of pleasure, and she would give
comparatively little time to serious things. She was
bound to be a butterfly of fashion, though her father and
mother would have encouraged her had she wished to
take life more seriously. On the other hand, they would
have been glad had Julia, their niece, shown some interest
in other things besides her studies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do care for other things,&rdquo; said Julia to herself, as
she sat before the fire this evening. &ldquo;I do care for other
things, though it is hard to make Aunt Anna and Uncle
Robert believe that I am not entirely bound up in my
studies. I really believe that I should enjoy a year of
society almost as much as Brenda. But the trouble is, I
might grow to care for it too much. I love study, too,
and I should be afraid that if I were to put aside my plans
for college, even for a single year, I might in the end
regard college work as a task, and wake up too late to
find society all hollow. No, it is better as it is, although
Aunt Anna feels that she has failed in her duty to me,
because she cannot introduce me formally to society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To some girls situated as Julia was, the line of work
that she had laid out would have been hard to follow;
for although not a great heiress, she had inherited fortune
enough to make her perfectly independent. Her purpose
in going to college was not to fit herself to earn her living.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to feel that I <i>could</i> earn my own living
if I should ever lose my money. It is not pleasant to feel
that one is only a consumer, a cumberer of the ground,
and not a helper.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Now Julia had already discovered that not all the girls
in college were there to carry out the loftiest aims. Some
were as evidently bent on enjoying themselves as the girls
of Brenda&rsquo;s set. Even thus early in her Freshman year
Julia had noted the difference between the two classes,
the workers and the shirkers. Of course, in her short
time at Radcliffe, she had not attempted to put all her
acquaintances into one or the other of these classes. But
she had already seen considerable difference in the methods
of her classmates. Some sat dreamily, even idly, through
a lecture, making only occasional notes. Others hung
on the words of their instructor, writing pages and seeming
fearful of losing a word.</p>
<p>Some took down the names of any books the instructor
named as useful for further reference. Others seemed
absolutely indifferent to everything of this kind.</p>
<p>Julia was not really a severe critic, and she made allowances.
&ldquo;I must not forget to tell Brenda that there are,
at least, two or three girls at Radcliffe who really enjoy
frivolity.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<h2 id="c6">VI
<br /><span class="small">SETTING TO WORK</span></h2>
<p>Pamela never for a moment felt any lack of liberty in
Cambridge, in spite of the fact that she had less of real
leisure than most of her classmates. Her life at Radcliffe
was so much nearer her ideal than anything she had
previously known that she was in a state of constant
thankfulness. Clarissa, on the contrary, found the very
atmosphere of the college restraining.</p>
<p>So few were the rules at Radcliffe that Clarissa had a
breezy way of forgetting that any existed. She disregarded,
for example, the notice in the catalogue that
students could board only in houses approved by the
Dean. She was therefore surprised when the request
came that she should call at the office to explain why she
had chosen a house where several Harvard men were
boarding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What funny ideas they have here in Cambridge,&rdquo; she
had said when describing the interview. &ldquo;Why, Archibald
is my third cousin, and we grew up together. My mother
and father would just as soon have him in the same house.
They&rsquo;d know that he would look after me. He&rsquo;s horribly
serious. I wonder if the powers that be here in Cambridge
ever heard of co-education?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the rule is intended for the greatest good of the
greatest number,&rdquo; replied Julia, to whom she had told her
tale of woe. &ldquo;With fascinating youths in every house
where Radcliffe girls board, think of the hours that might
be wasted in matching wits!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fascinating!&rdquo; responded Clarissa disdainfully; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
little chance that I would waste time over them. Of
course Archibald offered to move, but there were two
other Freshman youths in the house, and so I had to go.
My present abode is most domestic with &lsquo;Home, sweet
home&rsquo; worked in worsted on the walls, and a plush-covered
album and two Radcliffe students as the chief
adornments of the parlor. That ought to suit you, Julia&mdash;oh,
I beg your pardon, Miss Bourne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not Julia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I notice that people here are so afraid to call one
another by their first names. For my part, I always think of
the Christian name first. It has so much more character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So few people call me &lsquo;Julia&rsquo; that I am always
pleased to add a new friend to the list.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, since you are so very kind,&rdquo; responded
Clarissa, smiling, &ldquo;perhaps you&rsquo;ll let me give you some
suggestions about the approaching mid-years. I believe
that I am on the high road to success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then do tell us,&rdquo; cried Ruth, who had just entered
the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I show a frantic interest in all the reference
books mentioned, and I&rsquo;ve even bought one or two of
them. I also make a special note of any witticism&mdash;alleged
witticism&mdash;of my instructor. Then I&rsquo;m building
up a scholarly reputation by adorning my room with books
and plaster casts. When I have a brass tea-kettle I shall
be ready for company. But it will be tiresome to keep
that tea-kettle polished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s less trouble than you might think,&rdquo; said Julia,
laughing. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the advantage of owning a roommate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you are an angel. Miss Roberts, do you do all
the polishing in this establishment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! it wouldn&rsquo;t be becoming to disclose how much
work I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Clarissa, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a fair division of labor
after all for you to do the rubbing and scrubbing, while
Julia does the &aelig;sthetic and ornamental for the two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth colored at this remark, and Julia looked up in
surprise at the careless Clarissa. But the Western girl,
unconscious of offence, was looking at the photographs on
the mantle-piece.</p>
<p>Before Clarissa turned around, Ruth, gathering up her
books, had left the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did she leave us?&rdquo; asked Clarissa, discovering
her absence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she often studies in her own room. Only on
Monday afternoon does she feel perfectly free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; responded Clarissa, &ldquo;I am a little in the way
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as far as I am concerned,&rdquo; responded Julia. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been studying and I am glad to have a little rest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;A little intellectual rest,&rdquo; responded Clarissa, &ldquo;as the
Bostonian says when he goes to New York. Well, I
ought to come on Mondays, only there&rsquo;s always some one
else here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia was accustomed to Clarissa&rsquo;s badinage, but Ruth
unfortunately did not like Clarissa as well. Julia therefore
regretted her ill-considered remark.</p>
<p>Clarissa spent much time bewailing the fact that she
had to be a Freshman at Radcliffe when she had already
spent a year in a Western university.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa promised me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;eight hundred dollars a
year for three years, and I suppose that I ought to save
out of that for my fourth year. I never imagined that I
should have to spend four years at Radcliffe; it&rsquo;s just
ridiculous to have to begin all over again. However,
what can&rsquo;t be cured must be endured. But Pa will
always think it was my fault in some way that I didn&rsquo;t
get admitted a Sophomore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve made it clear to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; but it&rsquo;s hard to make any one not on the spot
understand just how things are. I might get through in
three years, just as some of the boys do, but I can&rsquo;t make
up my mind to grind. There are so many interesting
things to see and do in Boston. I really can&rsquo;t pin myself
down to hard study. In the first place, I can&rsquo;t get used
to the methods. It seems as if there is nothing to do but
listen to lectures and take notes. I&rsquo;m only beginning to
understand how to take notes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a science in itself,&rdquo; said Julia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should say so,&rdquo; continued Clarissa. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t
like to have any one see what a hodge-podge I made of my
note-books the first three or four weeks. I couldn&rsquo;t make
head nor tail of them until I had borrowed the notes of
one of the model girls to interpret them by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was hard for all of us,&rdquo; said Julia, &ldquo;at least it was
for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, our first hour examination showed that we must
remember the instructor&rsquo;s words, that it wasn&rsquo;t enough
to imbed them in hieroglyphics. Allusions that I had
considered mere ornaments I soon found ought to have
been taken seriously. Little innocent references to some
reserved book were of more importance than hours of
lectures. Alas! alas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia smiled at her expression of sorrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not laugh,&rdquo; said Clarissa. &ldquo;I had meant to
do most of my reading next summer, and I had not even
taken the trouble to note the names of the books referred
to. But I find that having electives does not mean that
you can elect to study or not, just as you please. The
mid-years will be serious enough, judging by the samples
we have had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clarissa was not the only Freshman to find difficulty in
accustoming herself to Radcliffe methods. Many others,
unused to the lecture system, had rested too securely in
the hope that before the mid-years they could make up all
deficiencies. As the college year went on they were
bound to find, like all preceding Freshmen, that lectures
in the end were far more stimulating than recitations
from even the best of text-books, and in the course of
time, too, even the dullest was likely to acquire the art of
successful note-taking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>The hour examinations at irregular intervals before
Christmas were often rude awakeners for careless girls.
Others were agreeably surprised to find their marks better
than they had hoped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s uncertainty that kills one,&rdquo; said Clarissa. &ldquo;I
mean to work so that my mid-years will give me &lsquo;B,&rsquo;
or at any rate &lsquo;C&rsquo; in English. The warning, you will
see, shall not have been in vain. I used to think that
I knew something about Rhetoric, but it seems that
I was wrong, though I studied it years ago in the High
School.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Clarissa&rsquo;s rather original manner of expressing
herself did not wholly meet the approval of her English
instructor, since the first examination he had expressed a
certain restrained approval of some of her written work.</p>
<p>In November even the shyest Freshmen had begun to
find their place at Radcliffe, and to feel that they had
some individuality. The classes, relatively small compared
with Harvard, enabled the members of each class to
know one another by sight and name, even if the acquaintance
went no further. But the new girls were impressed
by the fact that intimacies in no way followed class lines.
The elective system made it possible in many courses for
Freshmen and Seniors to sit side by side, nor did a
Senior lose dignity by associating with the lower classes.
Clarissa constantly commented on this evidence of a spirit
so different from that to which she had been accustomed
at her Western college.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Pamela accepted everything at Cambridge as a matter
of course. Nothing seemed strange to her because she
had expected everything to be strange. Whatever was,
was right for Pamela, so far as Radcliffe and Cambridge
were concerned, and she lacked Clarissa&rsquo;s bubbling energy,
which constantly sought some object to reform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say that I disapprove of the present state of
things, though I really cannot understand it. Here we
are in the same town with hundreds&mdash;yes, thousands&mdash;of
students, and yet we see few of them at close range, and
then those we know are only our brothers or cousins or
something of that kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Something of that kind&rsquo; is delightfully indefinite,&rdquo;
said Polly Porson, the little Georgian whose condescension
as a Sophomore had won Julia&rsquo;s gratitude at the beginning
of the term. &ldquo;You speak like you were disappointed,&rdquo; continued
Miss Porson, &ldquo;but if you stop to think, it&rsquo;s well
that we have so little to distract us. We are not forbidden
to cross the college yard if we really wish to. But only
think what a nuisance if they were permitted to walk
about our little campus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose that there is any rule against it?&rdquo;
asked Clarissa mischievously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Polly laughed in reply. &ldquo;Well, the average undergraduate
would almost rather be suspended for three
months than find himself within our grounds. Some of
them make a virtue of not knowing just where Fay House
is, and you&rsquo;d be surprised to find that many explain with
pride that they&rsquo;ve never met a Radcliffe girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must change all that,&rdquo; cried Clarissa. &ldquo;Not that
we are anxious to have the acquaintance of those callow
youths,&mdash;for they must be callow to look at us in that tone
of voice,&mdash;but we must do something or have something
here that will make them anxious to know us better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can get along very well without their society,&rdquo;
interposed Elspeth Gray, who happened to be passing
through the conversation room where Clarissa and
Polly and one or two others were talking. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not
exactly cloistered here in Cambridge, as girls are at some
colleges. Most of us have the society, more or less, of real
men, and we do not depend on undergraduates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; said Clarissa, &ldquo;we might have a little
more fun here. Now, Polly Porson, you must admit
that it&rsquo;s a trifle slow here for a college town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of us were not looking for fun when we undertook
to come to Radcliffe. Cambridge never had the
reputation of being very amusing. But I&rsquo;ll tell you
something to raise your spirits. Rumors of the charm
and wit of the Idler theatricals have begun to penetrate
the brick walls of Harvard, and last year we heard of
sorrow in college halls because men were not admitted to
the performances. What we couldn&rsquo;t attain through our
work we have accomplished by our play. They wouldn&rsquo;t
lift their hands to read one of our examination books,
but they would give more than the admission fee to see
us act.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they permitted to come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, although we really ought to find some way
of letting them reciprocate our interest in the yearly
Pudding theatricals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to be able to get up something to interest
them,&rdquo; said Clarissa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you act?&rdquo; asked Polly abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, after a fashion,&rdquo; responded Clarissa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, do give your name to Miss Witherspoon.
It isn&rsquo;t the easiest thing in the world to find girls willing
to do their part. But there! you must have heard the
invitation given at the first meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard it without taking it to myself. I&rsquo;m not the
person of talent for whom the Idler is looking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever her other faults, Clarissa could not be accused
of vanity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<h2 id="c7">VII
<br /><span class="small">ALL KINDS OF GIRLS</span></h2>
<p>Among the girls in her Latin course one had a particular
charm for Julia. She was tall, slight, and graceful,
with waving brown hair. Lois lived in Newton, and
often for exercise she walked at least as far as Watertown
after lectures. Sometimes Julia walked with her; and
although Lois was not too confidential, Julia had gradually
learned many things about her. She knew that Lois
made her own clothes, and that home duties prevented
her spending much time in Fay House frivolities.</p>
<p>So far as she could, Lois had elected studies that would
count toward her proposed medical course. She was
bright and cheerful, and always ready to help others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is certainly very clever,&rdquo; Ruth had said appreciatively
one day after Lois had given her a suggestion as to
the proper translation of a very difficult passage. Julia
was glad that Ruth liked Lois so well, for she had not
smiled on her friendship with Clarissa and Pamela.</p>
<p>Polly Porson liked Lois, too, although she was in the
habit of saying that her energy tired her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;You look as fresh as a rose!&rdquo; she exclaimed one
morning, as Lois, with cheeks pink from exercise, came
into one of the smaller recitation rooms where two or
three girls were studying together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I ought to have a color,&rdquo; said Lois. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
walked over from Newton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Lois Forsaith,&rdquo; cried Polly, and &ldquo;Lois Forsaith!&rdquo;
echoed Ruth. &ldquo;Why in the world do you walk
on a day like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is just the kind of day for a walk. I had to stay
indoors yesterday because my mother was ill, and on
Sundays there is so much to attend to. I hadn&rsquo;t time
even to go to church. But the walk to-day has set me up
again, and I feel equal to anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walking is as bad as the gym.,&rdquo; cried Polly Porson;
&ldquo;in the South we wouldn&rsquo;t think either exactly ladylike.
Why, until I came North I&rsquo;d never walked a mile, really
I never had, just for the sake of walking, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing to be proud of,&rdquo; commented Ruth.
&ldquo;Besides, I&rsquo;d like to see any one try to walk on your
Georgia roads&mdash;those red clay roads. I was in Atlanta
once, and I know them. We were there two days on our
way from Florida, and the roads were so bad that I wondered
that feet in Georgia hadn&rsquo;t become rudimentary
from disuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, it isn&rsquo;t so bad as that,&rdquo; said Polly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad!&rdquo; repeated Ruth. &ldquo;Why, we started to drive one
afternoon and our wheels sank deep into red clay until we
were nearly buried alive.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, it isn&rsquo;t so bad as that everywhere,&rdquo; reiterated
Polly. &ldquo;You ought to have gone out Peach Tree
Street; that&rsquo;s a right good road, with a fine sidewalk,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve seen Peach Tree Street, too, and I&rsquo;ll admit
that there&rsquo;s no excuse for your not walking there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly sank back in her chair. &ldquo;I never could see the
sense in walking where a horse could carry you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or even an ox cart,&rdquo; added Ruth mischievously;
&ldquo;that seemed to be the favorite Atlanta vehicle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder that you stand her teasing,&rdquo; said Lois; &ldquo;you
are more amiable than I should be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; responded Polly, &ldquo;this is my second year at
Cambridge, and if I would I could tell a tale of Cambridge
mud that would make Atlanta shine in contrast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Atlanta mud is red,&rdquo; murmured Ruth. But
Polly took no notice of the interruption, and the conversation
drifted from Atlanta and Cambridge mud to a more
general putting forth of opinions of New England weather,
a never-failing topic when two or more persons from outside
New England are gathered together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me the bleak New England climate before any
other,&rdquo; cried Lois. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t travelled, but I have seen
the products of the other climates, and ours has the
greater staying power every time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right smart cruel,&rdquo; cried Polly; &ldquo;I will never
lend you my note-books again.&rdquo; Whereat all the others
laughed, for it was Polly and not Lois who was ever the
borrower. The note-books of Lois, were models of conciseness
and neatness, and she was ever ready to lend
them to those girls who needed, or thought that they
needed, assistance. The borrowers were not always shiftless.
Some were simply careless girls, who found it easier
to sit idle during a lecture than to write. Some, indeed,
had difficulty in following the lecturer and filling their
note-books at the same time. To such girls the loan of a
note-book like that of Lois was a great boon. They could
copy her work in a time that was short compared with
what would have been necessary to decipher, expand, and
rewrite their own half-intelligible notes.</p>
<p>As for Lois herself, she often found it hard to lend the
note-book which she liked to have by her side when preparing
for the class-room. It was equally hard to refuse
when a girl asked the favor in particularly beseeching tones.
On reflection, however, it seemed selfish to Lois generally to
refuse merely because she might wish to refer to the book,
and it happened that her note-books for one or two of
the courses were travelling half the time. While Polly
Porson was one of the most persistent of the borrowers,
Lois never refused her requests. She was fond of Polly,
although it would be hard to imagine two girls more
unlike than the ease-loving little Southerner and the
self-restrained Massachusetts girl. The two were, nevertheless,
the best of friends, though Lois was a girl who
had few intimates. For one thing she was too busy, and
for another she had little inclination to spend all her
spare time talking or walking with other girls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Even on this brisk, cool morning, although she had no
lecture for half an hour, Lois did not sit down with Ruth
and Polly and the others. She lingered scarcely five
minutes, and almost before they had missed her she was
up in the library, with books and writing material before
her, ready for a half-hour&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, where&rsquo;s Lois?&rdquo; cried Polly, suddenly discovering
her absence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard at work somewhere, I&rsquo;ll warrant you. She
never wastes a minute,&rdquo; replied one of the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if it would be a waste of minutes to stay here and
talk with us! I&rsquo;m sure we have just finished a most
enlightening discussion of the difference between Southern
and Northern mud. We might have progressed to a discussion
of the difference in Fauna, Flora, and other natural
features of the two regions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget that <i>I</i> am here,&rdquo; retorted Ruth; &ldquo;it was I
with whom you were chiefly carrying on the discussion. If
the others permit it and you still wish it, we can continue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, indeed,&rdquo; answered Polly, &ldquo;I assure you that
I do not wish it. You can see that I bear no malice,
for I had forgotten that it was you who had said all those
dreadful things about my native State.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could contempt go further?&rdquo; sighed Ruth. &ldquo;You
would have been willing to prolong the discussion with
Miss Forsaith, but you think it isn&rsquo;t worth while with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of Lois,&rdquo; responded Polly, &ldquo;I wish that she
would amuse herself more. It&rsquo;s only frivolous persons
like me who can sing and act and study, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but Lois can act splendidly, if she only <i>will</i>,&rdquo;
said one of the Sophomore by-standers. &ldquo;I do wish that
she could be induced to help us with the Emmanuel play
this spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble is,&rdquo; said a deep voice, &ldquo;that Radcliffe
girls are too indifferent to fame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other girls looked up and saw Clarissa slipping
into a seat beside the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems ridiculous that there should be such trouble
to get girls for the theatricals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps many would not think it fame, even if they
should distinguish themselves on our Auditorium stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they look at things with a jaundiced eye.
Already there are traditions&mdash;I have heard them myself&mdash;about
girls who have acted in our college plays,&rdquo; said
Clarissa, &ldquo;and the greatest were the girls who made up
best in men&rsquo;s parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, Polly,&rdquo; cried the Sophomore, &ldquo;you must be on
the high road to glory, for,&rdquo; turning to Clarissa, &ldquo;you
have probably heard that she is our very best man. Last
year she just brought down the house. You really ought
to see her; she&rsquo;s immense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more than you are most of the time,&rdquo; and
Clarissa turned to Polly. &ldquo;What do you wear, seven
league boots, or something of that kind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; replied Polly, &ldquo;though if you&rsquo;ll come
round to my room sometime I&rsquo;ll show you some of my
properties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d be worth seeing,&rdquo; said the Sophomore, &ldquo;especially
if you&rsquo;ve kept that gold-laced coat, Polly, and the
high boots.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Deed I have,&rdquo; replied Polly; &ldquo;the boots are likely to
be in more than one play before summer. I&rsquo;m promised
for at least two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear that,&rdquo; cried Clarissa. &ldquo;You are the
very kind of girl to act well. I&rsquo;ve overheard you taking
people off once or twice in the conversation room, and
you hit them to the life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly reddened a trifle at Clarissa&rsquo;s words. It flashed
through her mind that she had sometimes mimicked
Clarissa, and she hoped that this was not what the
Western girl had overheard.</p>
<p>There was no trace of resentment in Clarissa&rsquo;s face,
though Polly made a mental note that after this she would
not entertain her friends with her impersonations outside
of her own room.</p>
<p>It was time, indeed, for Polly to make this resolve, for
without intending it she had gained the ill-will of several
by using her powers of mimicry too freely. &ldquo;Ill-will&rdquo;
is perhaps too strong a word, although it takes more than
the average amount of philosophy to make a girl proof
against ridicule. Comparatively few persons really care
to see themselves as others see them, and annoyance, if
nothing stronger, is apt to be felt against the individual,
whether friend or foe, who attempts to portray us as we
appear to those about us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>It was now late in December, and the greater number
of Freshmen had become known to the girls in the upper
classes. Here and there was one who, like Pamela, had
little to say to her fellow-students, and had as little to do
with those in her own class as with those above her. The
majority, perhaps, were like Julia and Ruth, friendly
toward all with whom they came in touch, yet never forgetful
of the fact that they were at Radcliffe first of all to
study, and that other things must be secondary.</p>
<p>Clarissa was in many ways unusual. She seemed
always ready for pleasure, and she spent so much time
exploring the historic streets and buildings of Boston that
her friends wondered how she contrived to keep up with
her college work. Nevertheless, although there was no
ranking in the classes at Radcliffe, and although there
were no recitations to give a girl a chance to distinguish
herself, Clarissa made it perfectly evident that she did
not neglect her work. She asked intelligent questions in
the class-room, and it was rumored that her marks in the
hour examinations had been particularly good. These
hour examinations, held occasionally without much warning,
were tests covering a limited ground. They gave a
girl a chance to recover herself, if she found that she had not
been thorough in her subject, before the severe mid-years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>Some girls did not care for Clarissa. They thought
her too pushing; and although partly right in this, they
would have been more correct had they said that she
was merely no respecter of persons. If she wished to
speak to a girl she addressed her without hesitation, regardless
of the fact that she had not been introduced.
Strange though it may seem, some girls objected to this,
preferring, as they said, &ldquo;to choose their acquaintances.&rdquo;
Not many, however, were so foolishly formal, and Clarissa&rsquo;s
chief fault consisted in a certain harmless officiousness, a
readiness to do things which really were within the province
of some other girl. She had promptly joined the
Emmanuel Society, for example, and had been a member
hardly a month when she told the President of Emmanuel
that she had invited Mrs. Skillington Squails, of Chicago, to
speak before the Society on her approaching visit to Boston.</p>
<p>Now it happened that both meetings of the Society that
were to be held during Mrs. Squails&rsquo; visit had been already
provided with speakers whom it was impossible to put
aside. Moreover, it was decidedly out of place for a new
member like Clarissa to make a suggestion of this kind.
There was an executive committee of the Society whose
duty it was to make all arrangements regarding speakers,
and Clarissa ought at least to have consulted this committee
before writing to Mrs. Squails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry,&rdquo; she said when the matter was
explained to her. &ldquo;But it seemed to be such a good
chance to get Mrs. Squails, that I thought that I ought
to secure her as soon as I heard that she was coming East.
You know that she&rsquo;s in great demand, and she never gets
less than fifty dollars a lecture. But she knows me very
well; she stayed at our house a week the last time she
came down into our State, and she would have spoken
before our Society for nothing to oblige me, and she&rsquo;d
consider it an honor to speak at Radcliffe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>Mrs. Skillington Squails was an effective speaker, and
her subject, &ldquo;The Organization of Women Workers,&rdquo;
might have come within the scope of the Emmanuel programmes.
But unfortunately, Mrs. Squails had recently
been speaking on the stump for a very unpopular political
party, and to invite her to address Radcliffe girls would
have drawn considerable adverse criticism on the college.</p>
<p>The President of the Society thought it fortunate that
the other speakers could not be put aside for the Chicagoan,
and in the end Clarissa was spared the embarrassment of
having to explain that her invitation was not official by
hearing from the latter that for the time being she had
given up her visit to Boston. Although the President of
the Emmanuel and her committee had been very careful not
to speak of this officiousness of Clarissa&rsquo;s, in some way,
possibly through Clarissa herself, the story had leaked
out, and nearly every one who had not met her asked to
have her pointed out. They were all anxious to see the
audacious Western Freshman.</p>
<p>Polly Porson, when she heard the story, had entertained
a group of girls with a mock interview between Clarissa
and Ernestine Dunton, the very serious and conscientious
President of the Emmanuel. She remembered that this
portrayal had taken place late one afternoon in the conversation
room; and although she had glanced out into the
hall to make sure that there were no listeners besides
those whom she had undertaken to entertain, there was
the possibility that Clarissa might have passed through
the hall unobserved. The thought of such a possibility
made the careless Polly rather uncomfortable, and in consequence
she was now especially cordial to Clarissa.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<h2 id="c8">VIII
<br /><span class="small">THE MID-YEARS</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s comical, isn&rsquo;t it, to see those woe-begone faces
erstwhile so gay and cheerful?&rdquo; said Clarissa, meeting
Julia one morning in January at the foot of the main
stairs of Fay House. &ldquo;Let us stand here and watch the
martyrs pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laughing at your fellow sufferers!&rdquo; responded Julia;
&ldquo;surely you are not out of misery yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, I have two more; but I&rsquo;d rather die with
my boots on, as the miners say, than be killed by inches.
Now just look there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Clarissa spoke two girls approached, one stumbling
along with her eyes fixed on a book, the other wearing
dark green glasses that made her pale face look almost
ghostly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t pass without speaking!&rdquo; Clarissa&rsquo;s voice
compelled attention, and the girl with the book looked up,
showing the usually bright face of Elspeth Gray, while
the girl in glasses responded in the accents of Polly
Porson.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m nearly dead, I really am, with one examination
to-day and another to-morrow! I had a perfectly lovely
time the first week, for not one of my mid-years came
early. I went to two matin&eacute;es and a Symphony Concert,
had a girl from New York over to spend the week with
me; but the next week when I began to study I found
I&rsquo;d lost the taste for cramming, and I&rsquo;ve sat up nights
since. It was three <span class="small">A.M.</span> when I went to bed last night,
or this morning&mdash;which was it?&mdash;and my eyes are nearly
wrecked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly from a seat on the stairs looked up at Clarissa,
who was standing in front of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad that I can&rsquo;t see very well,&rdquo; she continued.
&ldquo;I should hate to discover that you were laughing at me,
Clarissa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I do think that you are very silly.&rdquo; Clarissa
drew herself up. &ldquo;Look at me! I&rsquo;ve gained two pounds
since the first of January.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! haven&rsquo;t you had to work? You are an exception,
and this is only your first year, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I have been working,&rdquo; responded Clarissa,
&ldquo;but I haven&rsquo;t been worrying. There&rsquo;s little difference
to me &rsquo;twixt &lsquo;A&rsquo; and &lsquo;B&rsquo; and &lsquo;C&rsquo; and &lsquo;D.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said a Junior, overhearing, &ldquo;we shall see.
I felt that way myself when I was a Freshman. But a
change came over the spirit of my dream when I received
my marks. I&rsquo;d always thought myself a pretty bright
person before that, but when I found that I had nothing
higher than a &lsquo;B,&rsquo; and that in only one course, while
&lsquo;C&rsquo;s&rsquo; were alarmingly prevalent on my record, I made
up my mind after that to take examinations seriously.
I did better in June&mdash;I really did.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; interposed Polly. &ldquo;I mean to do better
in June myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to your own account, you did not plan
well for these mid-years. Wouldn&rsquo;t it have been better
to have spent an hour or two earlier in the year in study
instead of cramming it into a week? Wouldn&rsquo;t that have
been more consistent?&rdquo; asked Julia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might have been more consistent,&rdquo; responded Polly,
&ldquo;but it wouldn&rsquo;t have been half as pleasant. I never <i>did</i>
believe that consistency was a diamond of the first water.
Besides, it&rsquo;s <i>much</i> more exciting to leave most of your
work to the last. If I were running a race I&rsquo;d always
make my greatest effort on the last round. To be sure,
I&rsquo;d feel a little better now if my eyes weren&rsquo;t so troublesome.
But I must go on. Elspeth and I have some
German to attack&mdash;just a trifle, you know: &lsquo;Minna von
Barnhelm,&rsquo; &lsquo;Wilhelm Tell,&rsquo; &lsquo;Iphigenia,&rsquo; and one or two
other little things of that kind,&rdquo; and she made a gesture
of affected carelessness. &ldquo;Well, good-bye! Elspeth furnishes
eyes for me at present, and looks up all the words
in the dictionary, while I provide the free translations.
Free enough,&rdquo; she concluded with a laugh, as she disappeared
up the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; cried Clarissa, &ldquo;I can see that Polly is
worried. She&rsquo;s been summoned to the office once or
twice for cutting, I hear. She told of it herself,&rdquo; she
added, lest Julia should wonder how Clarissa had learned
this.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>Many Radcliffe girls, undoubtedly, took their examinations
too severely. They withdrew to their rooms at the
beginning of the mid-years, and came out only to get books
from the library or for examinations. Yet though cramming
is a bad habit, it is so firmly fixed on all students
that until examinations themselves are abolished it will
last. Poor students, who have wasted the lecture hours
and neglected the prescribed reading, cram because otherwise
they might fail outright, and so bring their college
course to an untimely end. Good students, who have
neglected nothing through the term, cram to assure themselves
that they have done the very best by their chosen
subjects. Between the men and the women students of
Cambridge, however, there is one marked point of difference.
With the growth of Harvard the profession of
tutor is of increasing importance. Young men of small
money and large ability after their Freshman year often
defray the greater part of their expenses by tutoring.
Many, indeed, of the youths who seek the aid of tutors
have never even tried to keep up with the regular lectures.
By some occult reasoning they calculate that it
requires less mental effort to wait until the approach of
the examinations for their great spurt. The gist of the
courses they desire is then given them by an expert who
in a few hours covers the work of the half-year. Lazy
men, athletic men, and men lacking the mental momentum
to carry them through college are the mainstay of numbers
of impecunious students. Radcliffe as yet has had
no attractions for girls disinclined to study. The majority
have had high standing in the preparatory schools, and
they go to college intending to do their best. If the Polly
Porsons have been inattentive to some lectures, or if they
have neglected part of their reading, they work with a
will in the weeks just before examinations. But they
scorn the help of tutors, or of printed notes. At the
worst they borrow the note-books of some other girl, or
they meet in little groups of two or three to put one
another to the test with difficult questions. Informal
meetings of this kind are the nearest thing that Radcliffe
can show to the Seminars (disapproved by the Faculty),
devised for the smoothing of the way for Harvard
students.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>Clarissa was one of those who liked to study in company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am twice as sure of myself when I have done a little
thinking aloud. Come on, Polly, one more hour will
make us perfect in English. I need you to hear me say
the &lsquo;Canons,&rsquo; and exercise me a little on &lsquo;shall&rsquo; and
&lsquo;will,&rsquo; and then I shall know whole pages of the English
Literature Primer. It&rsquo;s too bad that we haven&rsquo;t had
more courses together, for we work together splendidly;
don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Polly, &ldquo;especially as you have eyes and I
haven&rsquo;t. I am going to make up questions out of my
head to test you, for I mustn&rsquo;t look much on my
book.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that will be all right,&rdquo; responded Clarissa. &ldquo;Besides,
I have some examination papers&mdash;those of the past
two or three years&mdash;and I am going to use them for your
especial torment. It will strengthen your mind to answer
the questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, but if my mind required strengthening I
don&rsquo;t believe that cramming would help. A cup of good
strong coffee would be more to the point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; cried Clarissa, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve given yourself away.
I have been wondering how you kept yourself awake until
three <span class="small">A.M.</span> as you boast of doing. If coffee does it I
have only half as much respect for you as I thought I had.
If I could look in upon you some midnight soon, and find
you drinking strong coffee, with your head swathed in
wet towels&mdash;for this I am told is the habit with coffee-bibbers&mdash;I&rsquo;d
punish you as you deserve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I plead guilty,&rdquo; cried Polly, &ldquo;to the coffee drinking.
Why not, since I have a little gas-stove of my own?
But the wet towels, ugh! I could not stand anything so
clammy. But come! time flies, and if you are in earnest
about that symposium, let us hasten to my rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many girls studied wholly by themselves. Pamela was
one of these, and Lois another. Pamela in this, as in
other things, was solitary from necessity rather than from
choice. She had hardly a speaking acquaintance with
most of the girls in her classes, and it occurred to none
of them to ask her to join them. She for her part was
too timid to make the first advances. Lois, on the other
hand, would have been welcomed by many a little study
group. But she was of a decidedly independent disposition,
and she felt that she could accomplish more by
herself, and with a smaller expenditure of time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Her disinclination to be one of a crowd stood in the way
of Lois&rsquo; popularity. Her fellow-students admitted that
she was bright and amiable, and that she seldom said
sarcastic things. But they felt that she was not deeply
interested in them as individuals, and in consequence they
were inclined to criticise her. It was harmless criticism,
but it tended to increase the feeling that Lois was not
exactly popular.</p>
<p>Julia and Ruth, studying together, rejoiced that they
had the same electives. Ruth was unduly flurried and
worried, and she and Julia sat up until midnight many
nights when they might better have been in bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst of it is,&rdquo; sighed Ruth, after her last examination,
&ldquo;my cramming hasn&rsquo;t helped me an atom. Not
one of the four papers had a question that I could not
have answered before I began to cram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and if you hadn&rsquo;t sat up so late grinding you
would probably have been in a better state for work.
You&rsquo;ll take things more sensibly in your Sophomore and
Junior years. Only Freshmen and Seniors work themselves
into a fever. Freshmen are inexperienced and
nervous, and Seniors never feel quite sure that they are
going to pass in everything; but Sophomores and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say that I agree with you, Miss Darcy,&rdquo; said
Jane Townall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always tried to do my duty by all
my instructors, but I never went into an examination,
even in my Sophomore and Junior years, without an enormous
amount of preparation. It seems to me that most
girls do the same.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; responded Elizabeth carelessly, &ldquo;it all depends
on the kind of girls one knows. <i>Your</i> friends, of course,
are more serious than mine. But you all make a mistake.
You have lost five pounds, and you look as if you had lost
your last friend, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this Elizabeth hurried off to join Polly Porson, for
they both belonged to the same clique of rather lively girls
just at this time beginning to promote theatricals, tableaux,
and other frivolities, calculated to show that Radcliffe girls
had other talents besides the purely scholastic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy for Miss Darcy to talk,&rdquo; said Jane Townall,
turning to Ruth, as Elizabeth moved away. &ldquo;The loss
of a grade would not hurt her; she is not going to teach,
and it will be all the same to her whether she gets a plain
degree, or a <i>cum laude</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does pretty well, though,&rdquo; interposed a girl who
had just joined the group. &ldquo;She showed me her marks
last year, and there was nothing, I think, below &lsquo;B.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s an art in getting marks, just as there is in
achieving greatness of any other sort. Perhaps you are
not aware, Freshmen,&rdquo; and the speaker turned toward
Ruth and Julia, &ldquo;that one principle in selecting courses is
to choose those demanding the least work, and at the
same time yielding the highest marks. There&rsquo;s a curious
relation between the two. The easier the course and the
smaller the amount of work in it, the higher the mark.
Elizabeth goes in for such things as Semitic 12 and Fine
Arts 1, and&mdash;oh, well, we know the list. They are
studies that make for culture and high marks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;Also,&rdquo; said another girl, &ldquo;Elizabeth believes in making
a good impression on her instructors. She will break
into a lecture three times in the course of the hour to ask
a question which sometimes has only the slightest connection
with the subject. But often it gives the instructor
an opportunity for a series of footnotes to the lecture in
the shape of original remarks, and he ends by believing
Elizabeth to be the most intelligent girl in his class. He
keeps this in mind when her blue-book falls into his hand.
This is one secret of her succeeding without working, for
<i>she</i> says that she does not work, and <i>you</i> say that she gets
good marks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other words, she &lsquo;swipes&rsquo; marks,&rdquo; interposed
Clarissa.</p>
<p>Jane Townall looked uncomfortable at the tone of the
discussion. Personalities were distasteful to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Darcy is very pleasant,&rdquo; she ventured; &ldquo;every
one likes her. I envy a girl who has the faculty of making
herself agreeable to every one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane meant to pay Elizabeth a very high compliment,
but the two Juniors in the group laughed heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; said the taller of the two. &ldquo;Elizabeth
does try to make herself agreeable to every one. She
would rather be called uneducated than unpopular. I
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; she concluded with a smile, &ldquo;if she
had designs on the Idler. But then, she&rsquo;d make a fairly
good President.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but what a change after Miss Witherspoon!
Besides, I&rsquo;d rather see a girl like Lois Forsaith.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, of course. By the time she is a Senior her
turn may come, but at present it&rsquo;s out of the question.
Indeed, I doubt that she&rsquo;d ever be elected, however
strongly some of us might wish it. She&rsquo;s too independent;
and though she doesn&rsquo;t make enemies, she wouldn&rsquo;t
have enough people to work for her at an election. She
hasn&rsquo;t many intimate friends. You&rsquo;ve got to belong to a
clique if you want to hold office, or else be tremendously
and surpassingly beautiful or rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Lois isn&rsquo;t that exactly. She&rsquo;s just a good all-round
kind of girl with considerable talent, and she&rsquo;s so
independent that nobody ever quite appreciates her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Jane Townall primly, as the
group broke up, &ldquo;I feel as if in some way I had done Miss
Darcy an injury. I really did not mean to make her a
subject of discussion when I spoke of the ease with which
she takes her examinations. I hope that I didn&rsquo;t do her
any injustice. I&rsquo;m sure that I didn&rsquo;t mean to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you didn&rsquo;t, Jane; you wouldn&rsquo;t hurt a fly,
we all know that,&rdquo; exclaimed one of the Juniors with a
surprising flippancy. Jane was Julia&rsquo;s Senior adviser,
and her four months at Radcliffe hadn&rsquo;t lessened her awe
of Seniors in general, and of Jane in particular. For
although Jane was awkward&mdash;unused to conventional
society&mdash;and wrapped up in her studies, she had more
than once gone out of her way to help Julia; and while
she was timid about offering advice, when asked to give it
she was always logical and painstaking in what she said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<h2 id="c9">IX
<br /><span class="small">TWO CATASTROPHES</span></h2>
<p>One Monday soon after the mid-years Julia and Elizabeth
were walking down Garden Street in the face of a
rather sharp wind. Elizabeth, like all who are not Boston
bred, complained of the spring winds as if they were more
vicious than in her native New Jersey. Passing the old
graveyard, she laughingly reminded Julia that Longfellow&rsquo;s
&ldquo;dust is in her beautiful eyes,&rdquo; applied to one
who lay buried within the First Parish enclosure, and that
some wit had commented that dust was always in some
one&rsquo;s eyes in Cambridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet it&rsquo;s an interesting old graveyard,&rdquo; said Julia,
&ldquo;and sometime I hope to go inside and study some of the
inscriptions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all <i>mean</i> to do those things,&rdquo; responded Elizabeth,
&ldquo;when we are Freshmen. I did myself last year. Christ
Church is almost next door to Fay House, and it&rsquo;s one
of the many that Washington honored. But I doubt if
you go within it before your Senior year, unless you make
it your regular church. But, dear me! What is that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>A white shower was falling at their feet, and, looking
up, the two saw Pamela, the very picture of despair. The
three girls were almost in front of the old Dane Law
School, now given up to the uses of the Co-operative
Society, and the sidewalk was slightly glazed with ice.
The wind, blowing strong in the faces of Julia and Elizabeth,
had apparently carried the slight figure of Pamela
before it. Evidently, too, she had been shopping at some
Harvard Square grocer&rsquo;s, and in her efforts to keep herself
from slipping, her black woollen bag had turned over,
and its contents were scattered. If the grocer had tied
up tightly that five-pound paper bag of granulated sugar
there might have been no catastrophe; but in some way
the string had loosened, and Pamela stood helpless, as the
stream of sugar poured itself out on the sidewalk under
the very eyes of the fastidious Elizabeth Darcy. Elizabeth
passed on with a gesture of annoyance. On the steps of
the Co-operative she had seen two or three youths whom
she knew, and she did not intend to make herself one of a
ridiculous group. Julia did not follow her, as she swept
up the steps of the Co-operative. Nor did the Harvard
youths accompany her. Elizabeth was accustomed to attention;
and though these three raised their hats politely,
and although one stepped forward to open the door, she
noticed that the others hastened toward Julia.</p>
<p>Julia, too, had recognized the young men before she
began to help Pamela, and had she acted on impulse, she
might have passed on with Elizabeth, for she knew that
Philip was only too ready to criticise anything strange in
the appearance of a Radcliffe girl. But Julia would not
have been Julia had she deserted Pamela.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>The bag itself had slipped from the Vermont girl&rsquo;s
hands, and a note-book or two, and a number of loose
sheets lay on the sidewalk. To save these papers from a
coming gust, Philip and Will rushed forward. Had Julia
not been there they might have hesitated to intrude on
Pamela. Yet their natural chivalry would probably have
triumphed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the sugar,&rdquo; whispered Julia to Pamela,
and the young men as politely ignored it.</p>
<p>Julia, then picking up the bag, replaced the papers and
note-books that had been gathered up. Pamela, thoroughly
abashed, tried to take the bag from her friend,
with a feeble &ldquo;Let me do it,&rdquo; but Julia, finishing her self-imposed
task, introduced Philip and Will to Pamela.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to the car office,&rdquo; she replied in answer
to Philip&rsquo;s question. Therefore, across the Square, accompanied
by the two young men, Pamela and Julia
threaded their way between two lines of electric cars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re evidently dismissed,&rdquo; said Philip, as Julia
bade them good-bye at the office; and after a word or two
more, Will and he went back in the direction of the
Yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was rather plucky in Julia, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said
Will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Philip, who sometimes seemed to have
the obtuseness of his sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the way she tried to make that girl feel comfortable&mdash;I
didn&rsquo;t catch her name. But she&rsquo;s evidently
a shy creature, and she had got herself into a scrape with
all that sugar on the sidewalk.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that she was rather bright-looking,&rdquo; responded
Philip, &ldquo;though her clothes were pretty freakish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I fancy we were rather in the way as long as we
couldn&rsquo;t help much. Julia has probably carried the girl
home with her. Did she open her mouth to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who, Julia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the other girl. I didn&rsquo;t hear her say a word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she said &lsquo;yes&rsquo; once and &lsquo;no&rsquo; twice,&rdquo; replied
Philip, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; sighed Pamela, standing beside Julia, &ldquo;I hope
I&rsquo;ll never see any sugar again. I&rsquo;m not bound to do
errands for Miss Batson.&rdquo; Then, as Julia looked puzzled,
she began to explain. &ldquo;Miss Batson is my&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated.
She could not truthfully say &ldquo;landlady,&rdquo; so she
tried again. &ldquo;She has the house where I live. She has
boarders, and sometimes I do errands for her. It seems
easy to carry her things in my bag, but to-day&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you on your way home?&rdquo; interposed Julia, to
draw her mind from the recent catastrophe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I was going to Fay House to study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, please come home with me. Ruth and I
are always at home Mondays, but you have never called
on us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>Pamela hesitated. Every hour counted in her scheme
of work. But the temptation was strong, and she
went on with Julia. Although the latter remembered
that Pamela had never invited her to call, she realized
that she herself might have done various little
things to make the way pleasanter for one who was so
evidently alone. She could see that Pamela would not
make friends easily, and she had noticed her at none of
the college affairs since that first Idler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;College ought to be broadening,&rdquo; thought Julia, &ldquo;and
yet I believe that it has made me extraordinarily selfish.
I haven&rsquo;t the least excuse to offer for neglecting Pamela,
for I saw at the beginning of the term that she would need
a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pamela&rsquo;s eye brightened as she stood on the threshold
of Julia&rsquo;s pretty room. &ldquo;How lovely it is!&rdquo; she
exclaimed.</p>
<p>The open fire blazing on the hearth certainly gave the
room a cheerful aspect, and the little tea-table added to
the homelikeness of the scene. Poor Pamela sighed, the
comfort appealed to her. There on the table lay several
of the newest books,&mdash;one a volume of criticism that had
attracted great attention; another, and the best of all in
Pamela&rsquo;s eyes, a history of Italian Art, very fully illustrated.
She recognized the cover, and could hardly keep
her hands from it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>The general tone of the draperies was old blue, always
a restful color when not used in excess. The curtains
were of a soft rep in this shade, and beneath them were
spotted muslin short blinds. Two of the easy-chairs were
covered in old blue corduroy, and a third, of soft brown
ooze leather, was particularly inviting. There were two
or three small water-colors hanging there, but the pictures
on the wall were chiefly photographs from the old masters.
There were three Rembrandt heads, life-size, and a Madonna
of Botticelli, as well as his head of a Florentine lady.
A Turner etching hung on the little space at the edge of
the mantle, and two or three etchings of minor importance
closed the list of pictures. Julia&rsquo;s piano filled one recess,
and a bookcase that she had had made especially for the
room filled the other.</p>
<p>Before Pamela could protest that she intended to stay
but a few minutes, she found herself with hat and coat
off, cosily seated before the fire. Julia flung herself on
the divan between the windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really feel tired! That wind was very wearing.
After all, home is a good place on a day like this. I will
have the tea sent up before four o&rsquo;clock, or rather the hot
water, for I make the tea myself. Oh, here is Ruth! Do
like a good girl touch the bell. I like to start with the
water hot,&rdquo; explained Julia, filling her kettle with water
from Mrs. Colton&rsquo;s kitchen. With the aid of the alcohol
lamp the water soon boiled. Then putting three coverfuls
of tea from the caddy into a china teapot, she covered the
teapot with an embroidered cozy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please notice,&rdquo; cried Ruth, &ldquo;our silver caddy. An
old grand-aunt of mine presented it to me in her delight
that we were to have a tea-table. She had feared that
college would destroy our domestic tastes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Julia, &ldquo;we have made a great impression
on our relatives by demanding things for our tea-table.
When they asked what we wished for our rooms they
evidently expected us to say dictionaries or other books.
But here is a fascinating set of spoons from my cousin
Brenda&mdash;every handle different; and Aunt Anna gave me
this biscuit jar, and Edith Blair worked these doilies.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is that a Tanagra figure?&rdquo; asked Pamela abruptly,
pointing to the bookcase. &ldquo;How I envy you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it down,&rdquo; said Julia, &ldquo;if you wish to examine
it close at hand, although it&rsquo;s only a replica,&rdquo; she added
apologetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>may</i> I?&rdquo; exclaimed Pamela, lifting it from the
broad top of the bookcase. And while the conversation
flowed on she examined the figurine, fondly noting every
graceful line.</p>
<p>No one who looked at Pamela could fail to comprehend
that she must be more or less stinted for money. She
herself would have told you, had you asked her, that she
knew that her gray gown was of rather dowdy make,
although she might not have realized as clearly as the onlooker
just where the seams were crooked, or in what
particular places the skirt hung unevenly. Pamela had
at the best a limited wardrobe, and her village dressmaker
had not kept pace with city styles. Pamela herself, unskilled
with the needle, even when she knew that a garment
might be improved, had not the ability to make the
change. She consoled herself with the thought that no
one in Cambridge was likely to notice her. She was too
obscure to be criticised. She had always admired Julia&rsquo;s
gowns, so pretty and so simple, yet with the hall-mark of
good workmanship. Pamela was a lover of beauty in
every form, and she now wished vaguely, as she watched
Ruth moving about the room, that she herself possessed at
least one gown that she could wear as gracefully as Ruth
wore hers. Ruth was giving little touches to the furniture,
moving one chair farther from the fire, pulling
another out of a corner. Julia had excused herself for a
moment to rearrange her hair in the inner room, &ldquo;in
case,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that we should have some more critical
callers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Hardly had she left when there came a loud rapping at
the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; cried Ruth. &ldquo;It must be Percy Colton.
He often runs up after school,&rdquo; she added in an aside to
Pamela.</p>
<p>The door was thrown open with a bang, and there on
the threshold stood Clarissa, tall, almost overpoweringly
tall, with a smile on her face, a flush of crimson on her
cheeks, and a winter coat of a much brighter crimson on
her back. Two other girls were with her, whom she immediately
introduced to Ruth as Miss Burlap, of Kansas,
and Miss Creighton, of Maine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so much better,&rdquo; she said, immediately explaining,
&ldquo;to know from just what State a girl comes. You
know what to talk about from the start, and you can
account sooner for her peculiarities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth smiled at this sally, although she was not inclined
to approve much that Clarissa said or did, and she was
glad to see Julia emerging from the bedroom. Julia&rsquo;s
greeting was very cordial to Clarissa and her companions,
and Clarissa when she caught sight of Pamela greeted her
as a long-lost friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>Hardly, however, was the interchange of greetings over
when the half-open door was pushed open wider. &ldquo;More
visitors!&rdquo; exclaimed Ruth. &ldquo;How exciting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Blair entered Julia&rsquo;s study with lorgnette raised.
The action was involuntary. She had found the stairway
at Mrs. Colton&rsquo;s rather narrower than stairways she was
accustomed to, and had used the lorgnette to help her find
her way. Julia hastened forward to greet her, while
Edith and Brenda, with less ceremony, pushed past Mrs.
Blair into the centre of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how perfectly delightful!&rdquo; cried Ruth, and
&ldquo;What a surprise!&rdquo; said Julia; and the room which a few
minutes before had seemed large and comparatively quiet
now appeared small, crowded, and bustling. The four
girls who knew one another best were chattering, and the
four other girls, Pamela, Clarissa, and the two friends of
the latter, tried not to show too much interest in the trio
that had just entered. Mrs. Blair continued to survey
the scene through her lorgnette until she had seated herself
in an easy-chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s even prettier than when I was here before,&rdquo;
cried Brenda in her rather high-pitched voice. &ldquo;You have
two new chairs and a new etching and several cups,&mdash;at
least there are certainly two new ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; responded Julia; &ldquo;you must remember
that you have been here only once this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is really a very pleasant room,&rdquo; added Mrs. Blair,
looking about her; &ldquo;not nearly as unconventional as I had
supposed.&rdquo; Mrs. Blair had hesitated a little before the
last word. &ldquo;Feared&rdquo; was what she would have said had
she not corrected herself in time.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic2">
<img src="images/pic2.jpg" alt="&ldquo;&lsquo;An American girl&rsquo;&mdash;she spoke with emphasis&mdash;&lsquo;is her own best chaperon&rsquo;&rdquo;" width="500" height="756" />
<p class="center">&ldquo;&lsquo;An American girl&rsquo;&mdash;she spoke with emphasis&mdash;&lsquo;is her own best chaperon&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ever since you&rsquo;ve been at Radcliffe,&rdquo; said Edith,
&ldquo;mamma has been awfully afraid that you would turn
into something unconventional. That&rsquo;s one reason we
brought her out here to-day. We wished her to see that
even in a college room you could still be yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Edith,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Blair, &ldquo;I knew that Julia
could not change, but of course I can&rsquo;t quite get used to
a girl&rsquo;s having rooms just like a Harvard student.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well now, Mrs. Blair, you can see that ours are not
just like theirs. I only wish that they were. There&rsquo;s
no such luck in sight as yet for Radcliffe students as a
fine dormitory for our own use like Claverly or Hastings&mdash;or
even Holworthy. We can&rsquo;t have suites of rooms
and private bath-rooms, and all the fine things that Philip
and his friends have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; added Ruth, &ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t any proctor, even, to
keep watch over us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the things that would trouble me a
little. <i>Whom</i> do you have for chaperons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clarissa could no longer keep silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An American girl&rdquo;&mdash;she spoke with emphasis&mdash;&ldquo;is
her own best chaperon. I&rsquo;ve travelled hundreds of miles
alone myself. I&rsquo;ve even gone to lectures alone&mdash;at
night&mdash;and no one ever was rude to me. Indeed, I&rsquo;d
like to see any one try to be! He wouldn&rsquo;t try it a
second time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>Julia and Ruth looked slightly uncomfortable during
this outburst. Brenda and Edith began to giggle, and
the others discreetly kept their eyes cast down.</p>
<p>Mrs. Blair unconsciously raised her lorgnette again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;a young girl need not
look for rudeness. I was merely thinking that she would
be better with her own family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but if she can&rsquo;t have her own family, isn&rsquo;t it the
next best thing for some other person&rsquo;s family to offer her
a home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do not like the idea,&rdquo; said Mrs. Blair, &ldquo;of your
living outside of dormitories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the great charm of our life here is its independence,&rdquo;
said Julia politely. &ldquo;You know, too, that our
boarding-places must be approved by the Dean; and if we
are very hard to manage, we can be reported by our
landladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do they ever do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have heard that no Radcliffe girl has ever had
to be reprimanded severely. For my own part, I feel bound
to behave even better here than I would at home.&rdquo; In her
eagerness to do her college justice, Ruth forgot that she
was taking Clarissa&rsquo;s side of the argument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; added Julia, &ldquo;many Radcliffe girls live at
home in Boston, or Cambridge, or the suburbs, coming to
the college only for lectures, so that we ought not to be
under more restrictions than they.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;I did not mean to start so serious a discussion,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Blair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see your piano here, Julia;
music is so womanly an accomplishment;&rdquo; and Mrs. Blair
sipped her tea with satisfaction. &ldquo;You make a good cup
of tea, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you can report that we are fairly feminine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, Julia. But come, girls, we promised to
look in on Philip toward five o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Brenda and Edith were saying their last words
Pamela in her corner sat unnoticed with the Tanagra
figure in her lap. Clarissa, meanwhile, talked to Mrs.
Blair with surprising ease.</p>
<p>Mrs. Blair was accustomed to deference even from her
special friends, and it seemed strange to have this young
person meet her on impersonal grounds, and talk to her
merely as any girl might to any woman. Mrs. Blair
looked at Clarissa intently, without the lorgnette. She
had always heard that there was something queer about
college girls. Here was one of the species close at hand,
and those other girls in the corner, who had had so little
to say to her. They were all rather badly dressed, at
least one could see that their gowns were not tailor-made.
Julia, of course, was not an ordinary college girl. She
was Mr. Barlow&rsquo;s niece who had chosen to go to college,
and it did seem a pity that she had to know all kinds of
people. These were the thoughts flitting through Mrs.
Blair&rsquo;s mind as she stood there waiting for Brenda and
Edith. As they stood there the handle of her umbrella
became entangled in her lorgnette chain. &ldquo;Permit me,&rdquo;
said Clarissa, trying to help her. But after a little effort
a sudden jerk sent the umbrella against the brass fender,
and a bit of the delicate ivory carving was broken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, it&rsquo;s of no consequence,&rdquo; protested Mrs. Blair,
as Clarissa apologized for her carelessness. Then with a
farewell that was as cordial for Clarissa as for the others,
Mrs. Blair, with her furs and rustling skirts and polished
manner, had departed, and the room seemed large and
quiet again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; sighed Clarissa, &ldquo;there is something in a
society manner, for I suppose that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;d call Mrs.
Blair&rsquo;s pleasant way of saying things that she doesn&rsquo;t
exactly mean. Though I must have seemed a clumsy
creature, she almost made me believe that I&rsquo;d done right
in breaking that bit of ivory. It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve seen
a grande dame at close range, and it&rsquo;s refreshing&mdash;for a
change. Dear me!&rdquo; and Clarissa turned to Pamela,
&ldquo;nursing a doll? I hadn&rsquo;t noticed before just what you
were doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pamela reddened under this chaffing, for at Clarissa&rsquo;s
words Miss Burlap, of Kansas, and Miss Creighton, of
Maine, turned their eyes toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Tanagra figure,&rdquo; said Pamela; &ldquo;it belongs to
Miss Bourne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m just as wise as I was before. It looks like
some kind of a heathen idol, and you gaze at it as if you
adored it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Miss Herter,&rdquo; said Julia, hastening to the relief
of Pamela. &ldquo;Even Freshmen in Cambridge are expected
to know something about Greek Art. You&rsquo;d better get a
catalogue of the Boston Art Museum, and the next time
you go there you can study the Tanagra figures.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Clarissa, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your advice. But
now I must be off. &lsquo;Answers to Correspondents&rsquo; always
declare that it&rsquo;s rude to outstay an earlier caller, but Mrs.
Blair and your cousin so fascinated me that I forgot my
manners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Clarissa and her friends went away, but Pamela, at
Julia&rsquo;s request, stayed a little longer. Two or three other
pleasant Radcliffe girls dropped in, and she enjoyed their
bright, informal conversation. She found afterwards that
to meet any one at Miss Bourne&rsquo;s was sure to open a
pleasanter acquaintance than any casual introduction.</p>
<p>The memory of this Monday afternoon cheered her as
she set the table that evening, and waited on Miss Batson,
and washed the dishes. Fate, indeed, had been particularly
kind to her, for Miss Batson, who was apt to be
absent-minded, had herself bought sugar that afternoon,
forgetting entirely that she had asked Pamela to get it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<h2 id="c10">X
<br /><span class="small">DISCUSSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS</span></h2>
<p>The Easter vacation had come and passed, and Pamela
was pleased to find herself again attending lectures. She
had been a little lonely, for almost all of her classmates
had been away somewhere &ldquo;for fun or for clothes,&rdquo; as
Polly Porson put it. Polly and Clarissa had gone together
to New York, where the former had an aunt, and
their talk now turned on Art exhibitions, Waldorf
musicales, and things of that kind. Julia, yielding to
her aunt&rsquo;s entreaties, had fixed her mind more or less
attentively on clothes. Lois had had to put her own time
and strength into remodelling and shaping the lighter
summer clothes. Whereas in Julia&rsquo;s case her greatest
sacrifice of time came in the unescapable &ldquo;fittings&rdquo; which
she had to undergo at the dressmaker&rsquo;s. Pamela had had
neither fun nor new clothes to console her in the vacation.
She had been unable to afford the trip to Vermont,
and indeed she did not intend to return home for the
summer holidays, unless she should fail to find some
employment in vacation that would help her pay her
expenses during the next college year. Her one luxury
through the recess had been frequent trips to Boston.
She had wandered to her heart&rsquo;s content through the Art
shops, and she had spent many hours in the Art Museum.
She had saved car-fare by walking one way to Boston, and
this exercise in itself had probably been an advantage to
her, as in winter she had had little time for long walks.
The fresh spring air as she walked along blew many cobwebs
from her brain. For Pamela was not of a hopeful
temperament, and she could not help wondering where she
should get her income for the coming year. Her aunt&rsquo;s
letters were not altogether cheerful. Between the lines
she could read that continued disapproval of her ambition
for a college degree. &ldquo;If you had gone to the Normal
School,&rdquo; read one of the letters, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d be almost ready
now to take a school. Perhaps you might have had a
chance at the Academy. They say that Miss Smith is
going to be married.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll feel better if I tell them that I&rsquo;m likely to
get a scholarship at the end of another year. Oh, I do
hope that I shall take second-year honors! That will
make the scholarship almost certain. If I could earn fifty
dollars above my expenses this summer, and if Miss Batson
will give me the same chance next year, why, I can
certainly hold on until I get a scholarship. Ah, me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>The sigh was perhaps not to be wondered at, for Pamela
saw clearly the uphill road that lay before her. Sometimes
she could not help contrasting herself with Julia and
Clarissa, and the others before whom life seemed to spread
out so delightfully. She listened with interest to all that
these lighter-hearted girls had to tell of their vacation
experiences, and she bent with redoubled energy to her
work. May was at hand, and nobody can be utterly down-hearted
in May, with the trees bursting into bloom, and
the air growing softer and sweeter, and the bright spring
sun touching everything with gold, making even literary
Cambridge a pleasant place for the hundreds of students
who cross the Yard to the halls of Harvard, or walk
through Garden Street to Fay House. Yet despite spring
sunshine, Pamela shrank into herself, and even Julia
could not drag her out of her routine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t right,&rdquo; Clarissa remonstrated, &ldquo;to think so
much of Xenophon, Plato, and Euripides. They may
have been very able men, but to think of them alone will
make you one-sided.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had studied Greek you&rsquo;d be less frivolous,&rdquo;
remarked Julia, as Clarissa picked up a slip of paper with
printed questions that fluttered from one of Pamela&rsquo;s
books. Clarissa read aloud from the paper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;IX. Write on the results, to logic and ethics, of the
work of Socrates, and the impression which it made on his
contemporaries as illustrated in &ldquo;The Clouds.&rdquo;&rsquo; Is it
strange,&rdquo; she commented, &ldquo;that Pamela is half in the
clouds and here? &lsquo;Write an account of the life and professional
activity of Lysias.&rsquo; It would be more seasonable
to write an account of the professional activity of the
catcher on the Harvard nine. Throw aside this foolish
paper, Pamela! Why, the heading says, &lsquo;Divide your
time equally between Lysias and Plato.&rsquo; Your aunt in
Vermont ought to know about this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t crumple it,&rdquo; cried Pamela, flushing under this
badinage. &ldquo;I save all my examination papers; that was a
mid-year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To make a scrap-book?&rdquo; queried Polly, who had
joined the group. &ldquo;Excuse my smiles, but it seems so
comical to care tenderly for examination papers. Why, I
tear mine up, and throw my blue-books into the fire.
Lecture notes are more entertaining. Clarissa&rsquo;s, for
example! Clarissa, if your notes in History 100 should
be published, they would contribute greatly to the gaiety
of nations. You must not let them fall into the hands of
the profane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lecturer in History 100 had a rather original
method in dealing with his subject. His style was colloquial,
and when in his opinion the occasion demanded
it, he used expressions that bordered pretty closely on
slang. Nevertheless, he had a fine command of his subject,
and that he was a valued member of the Faculty was
shown by his standing near the head of his department.
That he shattered some of the idols that his students had
worshipped did not lessen the value of his teaching.
After expressing his own views fully (and sometimes
jocosely), he would always refer them to numerous books,
by reading which they could inform themselves on the
other side of the subject. Although open, perhaps, to
some criticism from an academic point of view, Professor
Z (for so he was nicknamed from one of his most popular
courses) was a stimulating instructor, and his Radcliffe
students set a high value on what they learned from him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>Nevertheless, Polly and even the sedate Pamela were
almost convulsed with laughter as Clarissa read from her
note-book what she claimed to be one of Professor Z&rsquo;s
lectures. &ldquo;Stage directions,&rdquo; as Clarissa called them,
had been used very freely. &ldquo;Here he frowned.&rdquo; &ldquo;At this
point he stroked his moustache and looked inexpressibly
bored.&rdquo; &ldquo;At quarter-past three he told us that he thought
that Cromwell did not deserve any further attention, at
least from him, and that we&rsquo;d all be happier for a little
respite from Puritanism. Whereupon he left us&mdash;fifteen
minutes to the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you like Professor Z to see your note-book?&rdquo;
asked Polly mischievously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I shouldn&rsquo;t care. I never do behind any one&rsquo;s
back what I could not just as well do before his face.
The worst, I suppose, that he could give me would be a
&lsquo;D;&rsquo; but I think, on the whole, that he would be rather
amused that I had had sufficient interest to take notes at
once so literal and so copious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but don&rsquo;t let that book fall into the hands of
outsiders. They might feel that we were not under sufficiently
serious influences. You New Englanders are so
serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Julia&rsquo;s the only New Englander here. You mustn&rsquo;t
be too severe,&rdquo; said Polly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; rejoined Clarissa; &ldquo;but speaking of
Jane&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who spoke of Jane?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, <i>if</i> we were speaking of Jane, it seems to me that
we should all say that she looks tired&mdash;too much work
and no play. She&rsquo;s something like you, Pamela, only more
so, though she has the excuse of being a Senior. But
speaking of Seniors (we really <i>were</i> speaking of Seniors
this time), there&rsquo;s Jane herself. Come, Jane,&rdquo; and Polly
raised her voice slightly, that Jane, who was passing the
door, might hear her.</p>
<p>It was after half-past four, and Polly, Pamela, and
the others were sitting in one of the vacant recitation
rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Jane,&rdquo; said Polly, &ldquo;we wish you to tell us why
you have abjured society of late. There have been several
teas lately where you were especially expected, which were
remarkably desolate on account of your absence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Jane looked uncomfortable. Was Polly making
fun of her?</p>
<p>Julia&rsquo;s more serious tones reassured her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, tell us, Jane. Ruth and I had the special honor
the other evening of pouring chocolate at Professor Judson&rsquo;s;
his wife is some kind of a cousin of Uncle Robert&rsquo;s.
But why weren&rsquo;t you there? You belong to the Philosophical
Club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Polly. &ldquo;You <i>would</i> have enjoyed meeting
some of your fellow sufferers from Harvard; there
were several sedate youths among them, Jane, exactly
your style. The paper was most improving; every social
gathering in Cambridge has to be opened with a paper.
Why weren&rsquo;t you there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clothes,&rdquo; replied Jane laconically, smoothing the folds
of her black student gown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I suppose that you do not care to go where you
cannot wear that becoming cap and gown.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Oh, Jane! oh, Jane! oh, Jane! oh, Jane!</p>
<p class="t0">Never did I think that you were so vain.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Jane&rsquo;s discomfort increased under Polly&rsquo;s fusillade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might be more comfortable in my cap and gown,&rdquo;
she retorted, &ldquo;but they would be as unsuitable as my
brown merino in some places, and that is the only best
gown that I own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jane gravely, as Julia stumbled; &ldquo;no, it is
neither beautiful nor becoming. But it has been very
useful to me this winter. I wear it at our college functions
with few qualms. It is only when I am invited
outside that I am disinclined to wear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that rather foolish? In these days woman can
be perfectly independent about her clothes.&rdquo; And Clarissa
gave her curly head the toss of independent &ldquo;Young
America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one can live entirely to herself, even in the matter
of clothes,&rdquo; Jane explained. &ldquo;If a hostess goes to the
trouble and expense of providing a pleasant evening for
her friends, her guests should wear festival attire. You
are &lsquo;asserting a false mood.&rsquo; Isn&rsquo;t that what Shaftesbury
would say?&rdquo; And she turned to Polly, who of all present
alone happened to be in her Philosophy class.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Clarissa, &ldquo;I agree with you there. I never
could understand why people in the East wear ugly
clothes at times when they ought to be in their best
bib and tucker. When I am invited anywhere&mdash;which
isn&rsquo;t often&mdash;I always try to wear something bright and
cheerful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poster girl!&rdquo; murmured Polly under her breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather be called a poster girl than a mummy,&rdquo;
said Clarissa, &ldquo;though you, Jane, in your brown merino
would be more welcome at some functions than others I
could name in purple and fine linen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I will wear my brown dress and never look too
fine,&rdquo; hummed Polly. &ldquo;You remember that Jennie Wren
married Cock Robin, who seems to have been a fairy prince
among the birds. Every one knows that you are sure of
a <i>summa cum</i>, Jane Townall, so that you ought to be able
to wear what you like at any time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t speak for Jane,&rdquo; interposed Julia, &ldquo;but I am
sure that in accepting invitations we ought to think of
what the hostess would like. Don&rsquo;t frown, Clarissa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course you are more in society than we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, that isn&rsquo;t fair,&rdquo; replied Julia. &ldquo;But college
girls ought to place themselves above the criticisms
of those who do not look below the surface.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One shouldn&rsquo;t think too much of appearances. Who
cares for narrow-minded people? We must take the world
as we find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; sighed Clarissa. &ldquo;If I had worn a conventional
Boston costume, perhaps Mrs. Blair would not
have gazed at me the other day as if I were some newly
discovered species. Next year I&rsquo;ll appear out in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me for interrupting,&rdquo; cried Polly, &ldquo;but let us
do the proper thing by putting the matter to the vote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Resolved, that no Radcliffe student shall accept an
invitation to a festivity in Cambridge, or the adjoining
suburb Boston, unless arrayed in a becoming light
gown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Low-necked?&rdquo; questioned Clarissa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cream-white?&rdquo; asked Jane with unwonted levity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Color and style to suit the complexion of the wearer,&rdquo;
replied Polly. &ldquo;Only no more dingy street gowns and
hats at evening receptions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though there wasn&rsquo;t a dissenting voice, all knew that
they were in earnest to only a limited extent. Yet the
discussion showed that dress was a subject demanding
some attention from even the busiest college girl. It
could not be dismissed with a word. &ldquo;If a hostess fears
that I shall mortify her she needn&rsquo;t invite me.&rdquo; A busy
girl naturally cannot give much time to shopping and
dressmakers. Often she has little money to give to
either. Yet by exercising care and taste, the girl with a
small purse can often work wonders. The world of
college undergraduates long since decided that there is
no real connection between genius and dowdy dress, and
that the wearer of a well-fitting gown need not lack
mental ability.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>There was some point to this discussion because invitations
to affairs outside of the immediate college now came
occasionally to even the quietest of the Freshmen. One
or two of their professors invited them to receptions.
Some of the girls living at home in Cambridge or Boston
entertained more or less. In addition there were various
college affairs to which the outside world was invited, and
those students who acted as hostesses or ushers were especially
conspicuous.</p>
<p>Simplicity was the keynote of most of the entertainments
offered outside of Radcliffe, as well as in the college
itself. This was disappointing sometimes to the
occasional girl, conscious of her father&rsquo;s wealth, who had
come to Cambridge expecting this wealth to count for as
much in her college life as it had counted at her own
home. Yet no girl at Radcliffe was ever so dull as not to
discover speedily that plain living really set the standard
in Cambridge, and that any departure from simplicity was
really regarded as blamable rather than praiseworthy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<h2 id="c11">XI
<br /><span class="small">EFFORTS TO HELP</span></h2>
<p>Julia, one spring afternoon, waiting in Edith&rsquo;s library
for Edith to return from down town, was in the midst of
a conversation with Philip. His woe-begone face might
have made her laugh had she not fortunately realized that
one cannot long retain her influence over the person she
has laughed at.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she hadn&rsquo;t written me herself,&rdquo; Philip was saying,
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have believed it. It seems he&rsquo;s a member of
Parliament, too. Well, I may be something myself sometime.
She might have waited. I can&rsquo;t fix my mind on
anything now, and I fancy mother and Edith will be disappointed
when I can&rsquo;t get my degree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have they to do with it?&rdquo; cried Julia. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure that they have always encouraged you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, if they hadn&rsquo;t disapproved of Adelaide Cain,
she might not have been so heartless, and then I should
be in better spirits now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t imagine,&rdquo; said Julia, &ldquo;that Adelaide Cain
threw you over just because your mother disapproved of
her? She hasn&rsquo;t the reputation of being so conscientious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How hard girls are to one another!&rdquo; exclaimed Philip
in his most cynical tone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! nonsense!&rdquo; and Julia laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m positive
that in three months you will rejoice that Miss Cain
preferred some one else. But did you mean what you
just said about your degree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my degree is certainly awfully shaky. There
was a scrape I was in in my Freshman year. They kept
me on probation, and they do not seem to think that I
have lived it down. Then I have two exams. to make up,
one I lost when I was sick and another I failed on, and
some of my work this year is a little uncertain. I&rsquo;ve a
good mind to cut it all now and quit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! leave everything, without taking your degree?
No, indeed, Philip, you mustn&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve only a few weeks, and&mdash;and&mdash;well, I
suppose that I might as well make a full confession. I
have a lot of debt hanging over me, and I cannot tell my
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Philip!&rdquo; Julia threw a great deal of feeling into
her tone. This last trouble seemed much more serious
than either of the other things of which Philip had
spoken. She felt that it was to his advantage that Miss
Cain had set him aside, and she knew that if he applied
himself he could make up his deficiencies in his studies.
But a matter of money&mdash;she hardly knew how to advise
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s three thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;Three thousand dollars! An enormous sum for an
undergraduate to owe.&rdquo; Although Philip had lately
come of age, Julia knew that he had no money of his
own. She knew, too, that although Mr. Blair was liberal
to his children he had a strong dislike for debt. She
wondered if he would come forward and pay this for
Philip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an old debt,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;It was made last
year. Part of it is money I really owe, but the greater
part is on notes I endorsed for Farlong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia had heard of Farlong. He was a law student
from a distance, who had made a great display for a year
or two. Then the failure of his father&mdash;a rather notorious
stockbroker&mdash;had brought his college career to a
close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued Philip, &ldquo;I was so foolish as to let
Farlong invest a little money for me. Of course I lost it,
and more, too, than I put in. Then Farlong lent me
some money, and when the crash came I was considerably
in his debt. I&rsquo;ve been able to renew the notes, but now
they have to be paid, and with interest the whole sum is
three thousand dollars. So you can see that I have enough
on my mind just at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he talked Julia realized that she could not help him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very best thing,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is for you to go at
once to your father. It&rsquo;s a large sum, but for a year or
two you can economize, and it will be worth a great deal
to get this load off your mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; and Philip sighed heavily, at the same
time closing with a snap the watch-case in which he carried
the picture of Adelaide Cain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Except for the danger of offending Philip, Julia would
have liked to laugh at his feeling for Adelaide Cain.
Adelaide was a distant cousin of his, several years his
senior, who had been engaged several times. She was
fond of attention; and as her latest engagement had been
broken off the past summer, she had let Philip dance
attendance upon her while she was travelling with Mrs.
Blair&rsquo;s party in Europe. Philip had imagined that she
really cared for him, and had written her many letters
after his return. At last Miss Cain had announced her
engagement to another. Philip felt greatly aggrieved by
this news. His self-love had been injured. Yet, if he
had been willing to admit it, his present discomfort was
caused by his money loss rather than by the loss of the
friendship of Adelaide Cain. But it relieved his feelings
a little to complain of the unkindness of this fickle young
lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now make a clean breast of it to your father,&rdquo;
cried Julia in parting. But Philip merely shrugged his
shoulders.</p>
<p class="tb">June came in as a hot month, making harder the final
examinations of the year. There was hardly a Radcliffe
girl who did not go about with a wilted air, as if life had
lost all its charm. The cool corners of Fay House were
occupied by students, and the beauty of the tree-shaded
streets and the flower-laden gardens was wasted on them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>Julia, Ruth, and even the discreet Pamela herself were
no better than their fellows in this matter of examinations.
Pamela, indeed, was especially nervous in her dread of
falling below &ldquo;A&rdquo; in something. With the hope of a
scholarship before her, she felt that she could afford nothing
less than perfection. Julia and Ruth, coaching each
other in Latin and English, studied throughout long,
fragrant evenings, when they would infinitely have preferred
sitting idly on Mrs. Colton&rsquo;s little piazza.</p>
<p>On her way from town one day as she stepped on the
open car, Julia saw Philip upon the running-board. He
carried his dress-suit case, and in a hurried glance Julia
saw that he looked worn and tired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what is it?&rdquo; she asked, as he took a seat beside
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you have a very melancholy air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I told you that I had several things to worry
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I advised you to tell your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve told him. I&rsquo;m going in town to tell him
something else now, and also to bid my mother and Edith
good-bye. They sail for Europe to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To sail to-morrow? Why, how strange! They will
miss your Class Day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>My</i> Class Day!&rdquo; Philip laughed sharply. &ldquo;<i>My</i>
Class Day! Why, I haven&rsquo;t any Class Day. I haven&rsquo;t
any Class, for that matter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Julia was almost overcome by what he had said. In
the first place, she found it almost impossible to realize
that Edith was starting for Europe without letting her
know her plans&mdash;without bidding her good-bye. At
least at the first moment it had been very hard to understand
this; if Philip&rsquo;s second statement should prove true,
that he was to have no Class Day, it threw some light
on Edith&rsquo;s departure. The car thundered over Harvard
Bridge; a fresh breeze blew from the river, and life
seemed a little better worth living than it had a half-hour
before. Julia looked down the river toward the city.
Her eyes fixed themselves on the tower of the old gaol,
and on the streets that ran up the hill, until at last they
rested on the golden dome of the State House. The
golden dome seemed to burn itself into her brain, and
whenever again she thought of this interview with Philip
it seemed to dance before her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Philip, about your Class Day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, just what I said. I&rsquo;m going to throw it all
up. I told you that if I couldn&rsquo;t straighten things out I
wouldn&rsquo;t stay. Well, I&rsquo;ve slipped up entirely on one of
my examinations, and that has settled the question of my
degree. My father is beside himself, he is so disappointed.
He&rsquo;s making a great fuss about that money,
too. I suppose that he&rsquo;ll pay it, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure that
he wouldn&rsquo;t pay any Class Day bills, too. So that even
if I could stay for my degree, I couldn&rsquo;t have much fun
Class Day. I&rsquo;m going to cut it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m going to cut it all&mdash;Cambridge, College,
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Law School&mdash;you are coming back to the Law
School?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, I&rsquo;ve had enough of study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had Philip looked closely at Julia he might have
noticed an involuntary smile. It did not seem to Julia
as if in the past few months Philip had been overworked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going on a ranch, or something
of that kind. Jim Devereux is out in Dakota, and
he has always been asking me to come out. I&rsquo;ll go for
the summer and see what chance there is for a fellow out
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t help thinking how disappointed your
mother and Edith will be. I know that Edith has set her
heart on your Class Day. Why, her dress is all ready.
She wrote me about it the other day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she could wear it just the same if she weren&rsquo;t
going away. There are others in the Class, and she has
had invitations. But my mother won&rsquo;t stay. They&rsquo;re
going straight to London. Anyway, Edith isn&rsquo;t really
out yet, and next year will be time enough for her Class
Day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Philip&rsquo;s tone made Julia think of the boy who whistled
to keep his courage up. They were near the Square.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;ll see you soon,&rdquo; she said, as Philip began
to gather up his belongings preparatory to leaving the
car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>Philip paused for a moment, bending down to shake
hands with her before jumping off. &ldquo;I am not quite
sure,&rdquo; he said hesitatingly. &ldquo;I should like to have a talk
with you, but I am really going away at once.&rdquo; Before
she could ask him when, he had swung himself down and
was hastening toward the Yard. He had murmured an
explanation about an engagement, and Julia had taken
this as an apology for his leaving her so abruptly. As
she recalled the interview word by word, she wished that
she might have had a good talk with Edith. The next
day was so hot that Julia went down to Rockley for
Sunday, and there, naturally enough, she found them all
talking of Philip&rsquo;s failure to get his degree. &ldquo;It all
comes,&rdquo; said Mr. Barlow, &ldquo;from letting a boy have his
own way in everything. I suppose that Philip has never
had an ungratified wish. When his father was in college
students had to study. I know how it was, for we were
in the same class. But now&mdash;why, study is merely incidental.
They elect this or they elect that, and it is all a
matter of whim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So students were altogether perfect in your day, Uncle
Robert,&rdquo; said Julia a little mischievously. &ldquo;Then it
wasn&rsquo;t you who told me of a whole class that was at least
half expelled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rusticated, my dear, or suspended; not expelled,&rdquo;
responded Mr. Barlow with a smile. &ldquo;Oh, I dare say
that we were not exactly perfect, but then, you know boys
will be boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but as I understand it, Philip hasn&rsquo;t even been
rusticated, and still less expelled. It&rsquo;s only that he can&rsquo;t
get his degree this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Mr. Barlow, &ldquo;it seems to me that
that is bad enough.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; interposed Brenda, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if he&rsquo;d
get it next year. Philip always could get anything he
wanted if he&rsquo;d take the trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity that he hadn&rsquo;t taken the trouble this year.
Really, I sympathize with his father. He has spent much
money on Philip, and here he sees him leave Cambridge
with a kind of stigma, for that is what it amounts to. I
doubt that that ever happened to a Blair before. They
may never have been brilliant, but they&rsquo;ve always had a
respectable standing in college. I don&rsquo;t wonder that Mr.
Blair is annoyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Edith,&rdquo; cried Brenda, &ldquo;just think of Edith! She
told me when she came home last autumn that she was
very tired of Europe, and here she is dragged off again at
a few days&rsquo; notice, and she wanted so much to have a
jolly Class Day. Even if Philip isn&rsquo;t there she might
manage to have a good time. She has as many invitations
as I have, and there are Tom Hearst and Will Hardon
and all the others whom she knows so well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, Brenda,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Barlow warningly,
&ldquo;that you are going this year only by special favor. You
are a year younger than you ought to be on your first
Class Day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, I know it, mamma, but I shall enjoy it
just as well as if I were a year older. Besides, I shall
go next year, too,&rdquo; and Brenda pirouetted several times
around the piazza.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>Later in the evening, as Julia sat on the piazza looking
out at sea, at the lamps revolving in the distant lighthouse
and the moon rising from the water, her thoughts
still lingered with Philip. The moon, at first a large
crimson disk near the horizon, had been transformed into
a smaller golden sphere nearer the zenith, and still Julia
sat there wondering if Philip had left Cambridge, wondering
if he would become a ranchman, wondering if he
would think it worth while ever to come back for his
degree.</p>
<p>Fay House, when Julia returned to it, had begun to
take on its summer expression. The finals were over,
and the entrance examinations had not begun. Very few
girls were visible in the house, although there was a
double set on the tennis ground and a group watching the
game. But within there was an almost deathly stillness.
The conversation room no longer re-echoed to undergraduate
quips and jokes, and the little brass figures, appliqu&eacute;ed
to the black wooden pillars of the mantle-piece as Polly
had described them, gazed on deserted chairs. The magazines
and periodicals were strewn untidily on the tables.
Into this room Julia wandered this Monday afternoon.
She fingered some of the magazines idly and then she
turned toward the window. As she did so she gave a
start, for there in a chair with her handkerchief over her
face was a girl. Evidently she was asleep, for she did
not stir as Julia drew near. The sight of the Vermont
girl there&mdash;for it was Pamela&mdash;seemed to Julia like an
echo of something that had happened. She remembered
that it was in this very corner of this very room she had
found Pamela looking so forlorn on the day of the first
Idler reception. As she gazed at her now, Julia realized
that in her absorption of the past few weeks, with a kind
of unintentional selfishness, she had really hardly seen
Pamela. Indeed, she had scarcely thought of her.
Julia&rsquo;s approach wakened Pamela, and as she pulled the
handkerchief from her face, Julia noticed that she looked
worn and thinner than usual.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;How cool you look!&rdquo; Pamela exclaimed, as Julia took
her hand. Pamela herself wore a stiffly starched shirt
waist of rather clumsy cut, a high linen collar, and a
heavy woollen skirt. Julia, in an &eacute;cru muslin finished
with a ruffle at the wrist and a soft ribbon at the neck,
appeared in contrast the picture of comfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do this summer, Pamela?&rdquo;
asked Julia suddenly. She wondered if Pamela might
not be worrying about the future. As the latter seemed
to hesitate over her reply, she added, &ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t you
come home with me to dinner, and then ride somewhere
with me on the electric cars, to Newton, or to Arlington,
if that would suit you better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wish that I could!&rdquo; cried Pamela. &ldquo;But you
know I am busy still at Miss Batson&rsquo;s. Couldn&rsquo;t you
call for me after tea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed. Will seven o&rsquo;clock be too early?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can be ready then, easily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia was prompt at the appointed hour, and before
Pamela could interpose she was warmly greeted by Miss
Batson and introduced to three of the boarders who were
seated on the steps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>As they reached the car, Julia, with her arm in Pamela&rsquo;s,
said rather brusquely, &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t failed in your finals,
have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no! But why do you ask?&rdquo; Pamela&rsquo;s tone
was one of extreme surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wished to startle you into telling me what
troubles you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I am foolish,&rdquo; responded Pamela, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve
been wondering whether it&rsquo;s really worth while to go on.
Perhaps I oughtn&rsquo;t to come back next year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you haven&rsquo;t had a mark below &lsquo;B.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had only one &lsquo;B.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And everything else was an &lsquo;A&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but I am afraid that you think me
very conceited to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not when I asked you. Well, if the trouble isn&rsquo;t
marks, it must be money. I should think that you might
tell me just <i>what</i> it is. You do not look as well as you
did when you entered, and you were not exactly robust
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s partly the hot weather,&rdquo; responded
Pamela, sighing. &ldquo;Then, besides, I&rsquo;m pretty tired of
Miss Batson and her household. I&rsquo;m glad that she is
going to close her house this summer. Otherwise I might
be tempted to stay on&mdash;to save expense. She&rsquo;s going to
take the first vacation she has had in years, and visit some
relations in the West, and she has been able to rent her
house for three months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I suppose that you will go up to Vermont for the
summer?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>Pamela received this question in silence, and Julia saw
that it had been ill-advised. Thus for several minutes
they rode on without speaking. The cool air was refreshing;
the electric lights here and there at the side of the
road threw strange shadows from the trees. There was a
certain pleasant weirdness in the scene.</p>
<p>Pamela was the first to speak. &ldquo;I do not really wish
to go up to Vermont. They think that I ought to teach.
They think that it is foolish for me to continue at college
when I might be earning. Besides, my aunt&rsquo;s house is
crowded now, and there isn&rsquo;t a room that I could have.
If I knew what I ought to do next year, I could tell better
about this summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do next year?&rdquo; repeated Julia. &ldquo;Why, you wouldn&rsquo;t
think of doing anything but come back to college&mdash;with
<i>your</i> record.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Julia had noticed Pamela&rsquo;s smile, she would have
known that its wanness was not entirely the result of the
flickering electric light. Her voice, however, betrayed
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may not be wholly a matter of choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve applied for a scholarship?&rdquo; Julia realized
now that the question was a question of money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I can&rsquo;t know about it until the autumn.
There are so few scholarships and so many applicants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that we ought to turn our faces homeward.
It&rsquo;s getting late,&rdquo; said Julia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>Then as they waited by the side of the road for the car
bound Cambridge-ward, Julia saw what she ought to do.
During the ride she had been pondering, and had it been
any one but Pamela she would have made an offer of direct
help for the next college year. This would have meant so
little to her, and so much to the Vermont girl. But there
was something in Pamela&mdash;an independence of spirit in
spite of her shrinking demeanor&mdash;that prevented her
doing this. Yet now as from a clear sky she seemed to
hear the echo of a speech that had actually fallen unheeded
on her ears a week or two before. It was the
lamentation of a friend of Mrs. Barlow&rsquo;s who bewailed
her young son&rsquo;s deficiencies in Greek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s disgraceful that Teddy is so unwilling to study,
and his father is determined to have him enter with Greek.
If I had my way he&rsquo;d give it up. Now I suppose that we
shall have to have a tutor. It will be a nuisance to have
an extra man in the house, but I suppose it can&rsquo;t be
helped. If it were anything but Greek I suppose that we
might have a woman, but as it is, I suppose that we must
make the best of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As this conversation came back to her, Julia wondered
that at the time she had not thought of Pamela. Possibly
it was because the words had not been addressed to her
directly that they had made so little impression. That
very night she would write to Mrs. Hadwin, and if it was
not too late, she would do her best to get the position for
Pamela.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pamela,&rdquo; she whispered, after they had taken their
seats in the returning car, &ldquo;Pamela, I feel almost certain
that I can find something for you to do this summer. If
it isn&rsquo;t the thing that I have in mind this minute it will
be something similar. I can&rsquo;t say more at present, but I
wish that you would trust me and believe me entirely your
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, of course I trust you. You have been so
kind ever since the very first day. You remember my
fountain pen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both girls laughed at the remembrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve been so despondent this evening you
mustn&rsquo;t think that I am always forlorn,&rdquo; said Pamela,
&ldquo;only it is very hard sometimes for a girl to work out
things all alone, and I really have no one to advise me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I feel very lonely, too,&rdquo; said Julia; and as
Pamela&rsquo;s hand touched hers in a mute response, she felt
that they were now really going to understand each other.</p>
<p>That very evening Julia wrote to Mrs. Hadwin, and so
strong did she make her case that before the end of the
week all the arrangements had been made, and Pamela
was the engaged tutor for Teddy. Her term was to last
three months from the last week in June, and Pamela was
to accompany the family to the seashore. The change of
air was in itself likely to be good for Pamela, and Julia
congratulated herself on the sudden thought that had
brought this piece of good luck to her friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet if Pamela had not been able to show such a fine
record for her work in the classics, any effort of mine
might have been perfectly useless.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<h2 id="c12">XII
<br /><span class="small">HARVARD CLASS DAY</span></h2>
<p>Had Jane Townall stayed in Cambridge until Commencement,
Julia might have had more interest in the
Radcliffe Class Day. But illness in her family had called
Jane home as soon as her examinations ended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry not to get my degree from the hands of the
President at Commencement, but I&rsquo;m glad to escape the
flurry of Class Day. I really could not afford the expense.
I&rsquo;m coming back, though, for my Ph.D. sometime. I&rsquo;ll
take that in person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no Radcliffe Ph.D. next year, nor yet the
year after,&rdquo; said Polly, shaking her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it will be years before I return,&rdquo; responded Jane
cheerfully. &ldquo;I must save the money first. By that time
women will be receiving the Ph.D. from Harvard itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubt it!&rdquo; cried Polly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d come back cheerfully for the two years of
graduate study, even without the Ph.D. at the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not with you there,&rdquo; interposed Clarissa, who had
joined the group. &ldquo;When I&rsquo;ve earned a Ph.D. I&rsquo;ll try
to get it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you wouldn&rsquo;t have been a contented Annex
graduate, with a certificate instead of a degree, stating
that you had received an education the equivalent of
that for which the degree of A.B. is given at Harvard
College.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor things!&rdquo; replied Clarissa. &ldquo;No, I couldn&rsquo;t
have borne all that they bore. I&rsquo;m not that kind of a
pioneer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane had secured a fine position in an Indiana High
School for the coming year, and her regrets at leaving
Cambridge were mingled with pleasure at the prospect
opening before her of having a fair income.</p>
<p>Julia and Ruth returned to Cambridge the day before
Harvard Class Day. As evening came they worried
about a few overhanging clouds, yet when Friday came,
the girls, looking through the trees shading their window,
saw that it was a regular Class Day sky, blue, cloudless,
while the air coming in over the casement was warm and
sultry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Julia,&rdquo; cried Ruth at breakfast, &ldquo;how <i>can</i> you be so
calm? I feel as if I might be Brenda, I am so excited.
I&rsquo;ve always longed for a real Harvard Class Day. I was
only a little girl when my cousin Augustus was a Senior,
and I remember how I stood about and watched his sisters
dressing for his spread. Even a year in Cambridge
hasn&rsquo;t destroyed the glamour surrounding the day. Yesterday,
when I saw that the seats had been put up around
the Tree, I felt that the curtain was about to be lifted from
the show. You are too calm, Julia, you really are, and
you have such a lovely dress!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is no lovelier than yours, Ruth. Come to my room
when you are dressed; I am very anxious to see it on
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls were now on their way upstairs, and when a
half-hour later Ruth entered Julia&rsquo;s room, each girl gave
an exclamation of delight. A third person might have
found it hard to tell which dress was the more beautiful,
Julia&rsquo;s white organdy, with its rows and rows of tiny lace-edged
ruffles, or Ruth&rsquo;s yellow muslin worn over a pale
yellow slip. Ruth was a brunette with Irish blue eyes,
and her yellow gown and leghorn hat with yellow crush
roses was very becoming. Julia&rsquo;s white hat had a pink
lining, and was very becoming to her rather colorless type.
&ldquo;You look like a white rose just touched with pink,&rdquo;
exclaimed Ruth, in a rather unwonted vein of poetry.</p>
<p>The two girls walked in a leisurely fashion to Fay
House, where, according to the arrangements made by
Mrs. Barlow, Toby Gostar, Nora&rsquo;s younger brother, met
them to escort them to Memorial Hall. Here in the
Chapel Brenda and Nora and Mrs. Barlow were waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were so afraid that you would be late,&rdquo; cried
Brenda as they approached. &ldquo;You know that our tickets
won&rsquo;t be good for anything after half-past ten. The
doors are opened to the public then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it is now only quarter-past ten, Brenda, your
anxiety was rather misplaced, but as we are now all here
we can hasten to our seats.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>Mrs. Barlow, gathering up her voluminous skirts, marshalled
her quartette to the narrow wicket gate through
which so many, many thousands of persons have entered
Sanders Theatre, and up the broad stairs into the great
amphitheatre. Toby stayed behind to take his chances
with the ticketless throng, crowding around the outer
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a garden,&rdquo; said Ruth, gazing about on the
rows of seats rising tier above tier, filled for the most part
with young women and girls, whose light gowns and
flower-trimmed hats gave the place the aspect of a flower
garden.</p>
<p>There were mothers there, of course, or an occasional
father; but on the whole the great interior was given up
to girls, who fanned themselves and listened to the orchestra,
and wondered if it wasn&rsquo;t almost time for
the Class to appear. Very promptly at eleven o&rsquo;clock the
Class <i>did</i> appear, fresh from the service in Appleton
Chapel and the breakfast at the President&rsquo;s. The Marshals
led the way, one of whom was Philip&rsquo;s friend, Tom
Hearst; and as the rest of the Seniors in cap and gown
followed closely and took their places in the seats on the
floor, every girl in the theatre tried to identify her own
brother or cousin or friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem too bad about Philip,&rdquo; and Nora leaned
over toward Julia; &ldquo;besides, if he hadn&rsquo;t failed so, Edith
would have been here. Just think of her near England at
this very minute, when she ought to have been here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say that she is more comfortable at this very
minute than we are. Only imagine how refreshing an
ocean breeze would be blowing over our heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Julia, how terribly matter of fact you are!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>Julia&rsquo;s feelings, however, were deeper than her jesting
words implied. In the group below, as she recognized
one after another of Philip&rsquo;s friends, she realized how
much he was losing. There is only one Class Day for
each undergraduate; and although he may make up scholastic
deficiencies, and get his degree with some other
class, if he loses his Class Day, something has gone that
can never be made up to him.</p>
<p>So although Julia listened to the Oration with its review
of the Class history and its promises for the future,
although she gazed with admiration at the fluent Poet
whose lofty lines were delivered in a rather feeble voice,
although she laughed at the witticisms and local hits of
the Ivy Oration (without always seeing the force of the
joke), her thoughts sometimes were wandering far away.
Indeed, it is to be feared that the last part of the Oration
was lost upon her, for when the Class rose in a body to
sing the Class Ode to the air of &ldquo;Fair Harvard,&rdquo; she was
surprised to find that the first part of the Class Day
programme was ended. Of course, like many others,
Nora and Brenda and Julia and Ruth lingered to scan
the scattering throng for familiar faces. Naturally, too,
Tom and Will and other Seniors whom they knew came
up to shake hands with them, and receive their congratulations
on having reached this point in their career; and
naturally, too, these same young men escorted Mrs. Barlow
and her charges first to the &ldquo;Pudding&rdquo; spread (where
nothing resembling pudding was to be had, except, perhaps,
the ice called frozen pudding), and then from the
&ldquo;Pudding&rdquo; to one or two private spreads, and then&mdash;why,
then before they knew it it was four o&rsquo;clock, and every
one was wondering if it wasn&rsquo;t almost time to go to the
Tree. Where had the day gone?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, here you are!&rdquo; exclaimed a cheerful voice, as
Nora and Julia stood on the lawn of Wadsworth House, a
little tired, a little the worse for wear, holding their empty
plates, and wondering how they had managed to lose sight
of Mrs. Barlow and Brenda and Ruth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, papa!&rdquo; cried Nora, for the cheerful voice belonged
to Dr. Gostar. &ldquo;Oh, papa, I didn&rsquo;t know that you were
coming out. How delightful! Are you going to the
Tree? But there, I suppose that you haven&rsquo;t a ticket;
they&rsquo;re so very hard to get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ticket!&rdquo; and there was genuine merriment in Dr.
Gostar&rsquo;s laugh. &ldquo;Why, you are forgetting who I am.
I&rsquo;m a graduate, and Class Day belongs partly to the graduates.
At least, the Tree part of it does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then we&rsquo;ll see you there. What fun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear me certainly. Really, I ought to be
saving myself now for the cheering. But I met Mrs.
Barlow just outside; she had to go with Brenda and Ruth
to Matthews for a little while. Elmer Robson was with
them; there was something in his room that he was
anxious to show Brenda. Mrs. Barlow felt that she could
go when I promised to take you under my wing. We are
to meet in Stoughton, where Will Hardon has a room
looking out on the Tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought that his rooms were in Holworthy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;So they are. But he thought that it would be pleasant
for his guests to have a room to rest in before going to
the Tree and near it. By the way, we have no time to
spare,&rdquo; looking at his watch. &ldquo;If you are ready, young
ladies, I shall be happy to escort you, although I&rsquo;m rather
surprised that you haven&rsquo;t some younger cavalier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, papa, we have had, but you see the Seniors
have all gone off now to dress for the Tree, and even
Toby, after he had gone with us to one or two spreads,
seemed to grow restless. I suppose he thinks there&rsquo;d be
more fun with some of his classmates. There are a few
undergraduates hanging about on the outskirts of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope that he hasn&rsquo;t neglected you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, indeed&rdquo;&mdash;Julia was the speaker&mdash;&ldquo;oh, no
indeed, he has been remarkably entertaining. He pointed
out all kinds of amusing college personages, and cleared
the way for us through several crowds, and saw that our
plates were heaped with ices, and altogether has been very
helpful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He really has, papa,&rdquo; added Nora. &ldquo;You see the
Seniors can pay little attention to any single person, they
have so many to look after. It&rsquo;s the greatest fun to see
them trying to be equally attentive to half a dozen persons
at once when all the time they&rsquo;re dying to talk to
some one person by herself. Even Will Hardon, who
seldom is disturbed, was half beside himself. He hadn&rsquo;t
had a chance for a word with Ruth, and wherever he was
to-day there were three tall, thin cousins of his from New
York who wished to know about everything and to see
everything, and who hardly left his side for a moment. I
think that Ruth was disappointed, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Nora!&rdquo; and Julia shook her head in disapproval.
But Dr. Gostar was too much absorbed in the
scenes in the Yard to notice this speech of Nora&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, papa, you seem to see a great many people you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly do, daughter; that is one of the charms of
Class Day. Presently I may run upon some old classmate
whom I have not seen for twenty-five years. He is here
escorting his daughters; and although my head is gray,
and his may be bald, we shall rush into each other&rsquo;s arms
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, who is he, papa?&rdquo; cried Nora, without realizing
that she was interrupting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I haven&rsquo;t the least idea; the particular man does
not matter. It will be some one with whom I can renew
my youth. Why, if it wasn&rsquo;t for Class Day some of us
old fellows would forget that we had ever been young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, papa, nobody considers you old. I heard Mrs.
Everlie the other day call you a perfect boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly feel like one to-day, escorting two fair
damsels through the College Yard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, listen! listen!&rdquo; cried Julia, as the sound of gruff
huzzas came to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have begun to cheer the buildings; you know
that that is the ceremony,&mdash;a pause before each old building,
and a loud cheer for it,&mdash;the Seniors&rsquo; farewell to
Harvard.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>They had now almost reached Stoughton, pushing their
way through the crowd. On the steps of University Hall
and other buildings, rows of people were seated, who evidently
were mere sight-seers, without any real connection
with the Class. There were small boys and girls among
them, and men and women in holiday dress, evidently
sight-seers from the City. In the throng hurrying across
the Yard there were now a good many undergraduates,
and anxious chaperons trying to collect their charges, and
pretty girls in delicate dresses hurrying toward the Tree
enclosure.</p>
<p>From the door of Stoughton Dr. Gostar and his party
hastened upstairs to the upper room which had been secured
for them. It was a large, square, old-fashioned
room, furnished rather more simply than those occupied
by Philip and Will in Holworthy, and it was far plainer
than the elegant apartments of Tom Hearst in Claverly.</p>
<p>As the others had not yet arrived, Julia and Nora tiptoed
around, looking at the curious gray and blue steins
on the mantle-piece, the fencing foils and masks on the
wall, the two or three old colored prints of stage coach
and sporting scenes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm, hm,&rdquo; cried Nora, &ldquo;whoever he is, the classics
do not occupy all his time. Just look at those membership
certificates; he seems to belong to every athletic
society in the college. And his books, where are his
books?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, here,&rdquo; cried Julia, &ldquo;on this shelf behind the
door. There are a whole dozen of them;&rdquo; and Nora, stepping
forward, read off their titles, which proved, by the
way, to be the titles almost entirely of college text-books.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear, you mustn&rsquo;t expect them all to be book
worms; it takes every kind of individual to make up a
college, just as in the outside world,&rdquo; remonstrated Dr.
Gostar in answer to Nora&rsquo;s gibes at the non-literary taste
of the owner of this room.</p>
<p>Before more could be said, Mrs. Barlow and Ruth and
Brenda appeared, attended by Toby and another undergraduate,
who was introduced as the owner of the room.
The latter was a mild-mannered, young-looking Junior,
not at all the athletic individual&mdash;at least in appearance&mdash;whom
the girls had pictured from the trophies and
other adornments of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, Mrs. Barlow, I hand my charges over to you,&rdquo;
and Dr. Gostar hurried off to join the Alumni around the
Tree. In a few minutes Mrs. Barlow and the others followed,
leaving the room in Stoughton to some other guests
of Will&rsquo;s, who were to watch the Tree exercises from the
windows.</p>
<p>Already the throng in the Yard was crowding toward
the Tree enclosure, and the ticket holders had hard work
to thread their way among curious by-standers. Within
the enclosure the sun beat down hotly, except in one
corner where the brick walls of the neighboring buildings
cast a shade. Following the boys, Mrs. Barlow and the
girls scrambled up over the rough wooden benches,&mdash;&ldquo;just
like circus seats,&rdquo; said Nora,&mdash;and at last, a little out
of breath, and with many apologies to those whom they
disturbed in their progress, they reached their own
places.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Now, although Brenda and her friends did not then
realize it, these Tree exercises were to have a peculiar
interest from being almost the last under the walls of
Stoughton. The space was too limited for the thousands
who felt that they had a right to be spectators, and already
plans were making for a change of place and a somewhat
different performance.</p>
<p>As the Alumni came in, taking position some distance
from the Tree, the girls caught sight of Dr. Gostar and
two or three sedate Bostonians of his age seating themselves
on the grass, and looking as cheerful and merry
as the youngest undergraduate there. The Alumni had
marched within the enclosure with a band of music at the
head, and then had followed the Freshmen, with the
Sophomores second and the Juniors last. Each formed a
separate circle around the Tree, and when the signal was
given all rose and cheered lustily for every college official
from the President to John the Orangeman. The
Chief Marshal, a tall, handsome fellow, led the cheering,
and at last at a given signal the students in each circle,
joining hands, whirled at a mad rate around the Tree.
When they had sung the Class Ode, the Marshal threw
his hat against the Tree, and then the wild scramble for
the flowers began. It was difficult for those who knew
them best to recognize their especial Seniors in the shocking
bad clothes and old hats that they wore. But many a
mother, when she discovered her boy, was sure that he
must come away with broken limbs, if he escaped alive
from the wild scrimmage. They pommeled one another,
formed themselves into human ladders, flung one another
off from the sides of the Tree. Yet strange to say, no one
received serious injury, and the few who reached the
glowing wreath were loudly cheered, even by those who
thought the whole affair rather brutal. Those who
stripped the wreath from the Tree flung the fragments
down among their classmates, and in the end nearly every
one had a flower or two as a memento. As Tom and
Will pressed through the crowd with fairly large bouquets&mdash;at
least they could be seen by Brenda and her
friends&mdash;the girls wondered if any of the trophies should
pass to them. While they stood for a moment waiting a
chance to pass down to the Yard, Mrs. Barlow pointed
out one distinguished person after another among the
spectators at the Tree, including the British Minister, the
Secretary of the Navy, the Governor of New York, and
innumerable literary and professional men of note. Many
of them undoubtedly were there as relatives of Seniors,
and some probably found it a distinction to be the father
of a boy who was the idol of his class for this thing or that,&mdash;athletics
and social graces sometimes ranking ahead of
scholarship.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>When Will and Tom reached Mrs. Barlow&rsquo;s group their
flowers were rather impartially distributed among the four,
and the boys hurried on to array themselves in proper
Senior garb. They all met again at the Beck spread, and
from that they went to one or two smaller teas, sitting in
windows that overlooked the quadrangle until the Yard
had been illuminated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairyland only faintly describes it,&rdquo; said Julia, looking
at the wonderful labyrinth of lanterns and colored
lights shining above the crowds in gay attire threading
the paths, or seated on the grass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>Julia was loath to leave the scene even for a glimpse of
the dancers in Memorial and the Gymnasium. When an
opportunity therefore came for her to go back to the rooms
in Holworthy under Toby&rsquo;s protection, she was glad
enough to go. She was a little tired now, and did not
sit in the window, and when Toby seemed restless, she
advised him to go back to Memorial, as she would be perfectly
comfortable in the easy-chair that he had drawn up
for her. She added that she would not be at all lonely.</p>
<p>Hardly had Toby left her when a familiar voice fell on
her ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toby told me that you were in here, Julia, but where
are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia rose from the easy-chair, the deep back of which
hid her from view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Philip! How in the world do you happen to be
here? I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t actually left this part of the world.
I&rsquo;ve been down to the shore for a day or two getting my
things together. I&rsquo;m off to-night by the midnight train.
But I couldn&rsquo;t resist a glance at Class Day. Besides,&rdquo;
a trifle less defiantly, &ldquo;I thought that I might see you,
Julia.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; replied Julia, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re all here, Ruth and
Brenda and Nora; they&rsquo;ll be coming back from Memorial
after a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll be out of the way before that. I made Toby
swear not to say a word about me. No, I didn&rsquo;t expect
really to see any one, though I hoped that I might run
across you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry that things have gone badly with
you, but next year&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not coming back next year, nor am I going
to cry about spilled milk. What&rsquo;s the good? Nobody
really cares what becomes of a fellow. Of course a family
is mortified when he doesn&rsquo;t get his degree, and I&rsquo;ve had
it heavy enough from my father for the money he&rsquo;s had to
put up for me. But you are a sensible girl, Julia, and
I&rsquo;ve wanted to tell you that in many ways you&rsquo;ve done
me a lot of good. Sometime, perhaps, I may show you
that I&rsquo;ve profited by some of your advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never given you any real advice.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed you have. Of course I&rsquo;ve had it from other
people, too. But you&rsquo;ve said some things that really
have made an impression. But there, what&rsquo;s the use of
talking? Sometime you&rsquo;ll see that I&rsquo;m not as black as
I&rsquo;m painted. So now I must be off, for I&rsquo;ve some things
to attend to in the Square, and I don&rsquo;t want the others to
find me here. There&rsquo;d be such a beastly lot of explaining,&rdquo;
and so with a sudden farewell, Philip hurried out of
the room. Julia, looking from the window, followed him
for a moment until he was lost in the crowd. At this
moment the Glee Club, stationed on the green, sang &ldquo;Fair
Harvard,&rdquo; and Julia wondered if the pathetic music struck
Philip&rsquo;s ears with the sadness with which it fell on hers.</p>
<p>Not long after this Mrs. Barlow and the girls appeared.
The latter were by no means ready to go home, tired
though they were after their long day. But Mrs. Barlow
was firm; and in spite of the protests of Tom and Will
and one or two others, they left the Yard before half-past
ten.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<h2 id="c13">XIII
<br /><span class="small">VARIOUS AMBITIONS</span></h2>
<p>The summer passed quickly away, as vacations have a
fashion of doing, even when one is young, and Julia and
Ruth and Polly and Clarissa and Lois and all the other
college friends met again in October, well and happy.
Polly had been at Atlantic City, Clarissa had joined her
family at the White Mountains, Pamela had been on the
South Shore with her pupil, Nora had spent the summer
in Maine. Lois alone of this group of friends had had
practically no change of scene; she had stayed in Newton
all summer, and yet she returned to college looking as
bright as any of the others. Julia&rsquo;s summer does not form
properly a part of her Radcliffe days, and yet it is only fair
to say that Julia&rsquo;s summer had been somewhat different
from what might have been prophesied in June. The
first weeks had been spent in attendance on her Aunt
Anna, who had fallen ill with a slow fever in the early
spring. When she was better the doctor had ordered
a complete change of air, with the result that Mr. and
Mrs. Barlow and the two girls had made a tour of the
British Provinces. Coming back to college from so many
points of the compass, the Sophomores all had naturally
much to tell. They registered themselves promptly on
the first Thursday of the term; they chose their electives
and changed their minds as often as the authorities would
permit. They studied the notices on the bulletin board
and the schedule of recitations, and advised one another in
tones much more confident than a year ago. They did
their part at the Freshman reception to make the incoming
class feel perfectly at home, and they began to develop a
class spirit. Now &ldquo;class spirit&rdquo; is something which had
only just begun to develop at Radcliffe, and indeed at this
time some of the upper class girls, absorbed in their work,
were disinclined to believe that it had an existence.
Different things were contributing to this class feeling.
One was the increasing interest in athletics. Each class
had its basket ball team and its own athletes, or gymnasts
as perhaps we ought to say, in whose triumphs it took a
genuine pride. Clarissa had come to the front as one of
the best athletes of her class, and the Sophomores with her
help expected to lead in the spring meet. Julia, too,
found herself suddenly conspicuous from a very simple
thing, or at least it seemed simple to her. She had always
had some talent for musical composition, and had studied
Composition before entering Radcliffe. But the course in
Harmony under the distinguished head of the Music
Department had been a revelation to her, and she had
begun to venture on little flights of her own. One of her
songs, a setting of William Watson&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Tell me not now,&rdquo;
Polly had picked up as it lay in manuscript on her desk.
Now Polly had a sweet, bird-like voice, and she rushed to
the piano and trilled off:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Tell me not now, if love for love</p>
<p class="t">Thou canst return,</p>
<p class="t0">Now while around us and above</p>
<p class="t">Day&rsquo;s flambeaux burn.</p>
<p class="t0">Not in clear noon, with speech as clear,</p>
<p class="t">Thy heart avow,</p>
<p class="t0">For every gossip wind to hear;</p>
<p class="t">Tell me not now.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Julia herself, as she listened, found her own music more
interesting than she had imagined it. Polly, when she had
finished, turned around with an amused expression:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, I am perfectly surprised that you are so
sentimental, Julia Bourne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense!&rdquo; responded Julia, &ldquo;but you sing it like
an angel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Polly, &ldquo;this time I&rsquo;ll accept the compliment
without protest, for with your leave (or without it)
I&rsquo;m going to sing this at the next Idler. I&rsquo;ve been
asked to sing something, and I&rsquo;ll take care to let every one
know that you are the composer of this sentimental ode.
You! the stern person who used to frown on me last
spring when I wanted to go to Riverside on canoe expeditions
that meant a <i>solitude &agrave; deux</i>. Ah, Julia, this song
shows that you are human like the rest of us;&rdquo; and Polly
held high above her head the manuscript that Julia tried
to seize.</p>
<p>Thus Julia made her first appearance before her fellow-students
as a composer, for Polly sang &ldquo;Tell me not
now&rdquo; with great effect that Friday afternoon; and Julia,
who hitherto had had comparatively few acquaintances
outside of her special set, now found herself an object of
interest to the whole club.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;The next thing,&rdquo; said Ruth, with genuine pride in
Julia&rsquo;s triumph, &ldquo;the next thing we&rsquo;ll have you composing
an operetta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; cried Julia. &ldquo;An operetta! I couldn&rsquo;t
do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? Three or four operettas have been composed
and given by Radcliffe girls with great success.
Why, I came out with my mother the year &lsquo;A Copper
Complication&rsquo; was given, and I never saw anything more
entertaining in my life. What one girl can accomplish
another can, I mean if she has the same kind of talent.
Why, there have been several Radcliffe operettas&mdash;&lsquo;Princess
Perfection,&rsquo; &lsquo;A Copper Complication.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The urgings of Polly and Ruth, however, might not have
led Julia to take up the work had not the Emmanuel Society
needed funds. It had committed itself to assist in maintaining
a reading-room at the North End for working girls,
and its expenses had been heavier than the first estimates.
In no way could money be so readily raised as through an
operetta, and as Julia was especially interested in this
Society, she at last consented to see what she could do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;For any one with talent like yours it isn&rsquo;t so very
hard,&rdquo; said Polly persuasively. &ldquo;Ruth and I will help
you with the book, and then you must have some good
soprano solos&mdash;for me&mdash;and some manly contralto solos,
probably for Clarissa, if we can only get her to take them;
and then there must be a soubrette song or two&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
find the soubrette, and there must be a man&rsquo;s funny part,
like Charles River, the &lsquo;winter man&rsquo; in &lsquo;A Copper
Complication,&rsquo;&rdquo; and Polly spun round the room, singing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Now since men are always busy in this lovely summer time,</p>
<p class="t0">I get my little innings when I can,</p>
<p class="t0">As I wanted to offset a bit the summer girl&rsquo;s &eacute;clat,</p>
<p class="t0">I call myself a winter man.</p>
<p class="t0">I drive out, I dine out at functions divine,</p>
<p class="t0">At parties I dance with the belle of the ball.</p>
<p class="t0">It is in the winter I have my good time.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no indeed!&rdquo; interrupted Ruth. &ldquo;Julia&rsquo;s opera
will have no frivolous Charles River. Her hero, I&rsquo;m sure,
will be a most serious person with high purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a low voice, that is, low for an alto,&rdquo; cried the
irrepressible Polly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Julia, smiling, &ldquo;as my part is to be so
small, I need not have hesitated about undertaking it.
You are arranging for the words and the speakers, and the
music is only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Julia, of <i>course</i> the <i>music&rsquo;s</i> the thing, the chief
thing, but there&rsquo;s a certain type of song that&rsquo;s taking, and
we have to think what will best suit our prima donnas,
when once we have secured them. You have no idea how
shy they are. I shouldn&rsquo;t care to be the business manager
of this affair,&rdquo; and Polly flung herself on the couch, while
the others laughed at her affected melancholy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>Yet in spite of this badinage, the girls of Julia&rsquo;s group,
as well as some others with special literary or dramatic
talent, began to work for the success of the operetta. The
music was left entirely to Julia; but the libretto, or
&ldquo;book&rdquo; as they all preferred to call it, was to be a composite
production. The sentimental lyrics were nearly all
assigned to Ruth; the comic words for the most part grew.
Girls are more considerate than boys. Their jokes are
seldom &ldquo;grinds&rdquo; on the professors, and they are even
fairly tender toward the various branches of a college curriculum.
The gibes, therefore, of Radcliffe plays were
more apt to be directed toward local faults, such as muddy
sidewalks and dusty streets.</p>
<p>Yet after all, the operetta was entirely secondary to
regular college work. Hardly a girl in Julia&rsquo;s class sought
the name of &ldquo;grind,&rdquo; and few deserved it. The absence
of the dormitory system, the very fact that many Radcliffe
students reside with their parents while attending college,
makes for a normal life in which home interests and society
have their place as well as study. This is as it
should be, and is not to be criticised unless a girl assumes
too many social duties in addition to her college obligations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>The autumn calendar was marked by several events of
special significance to the Sophomores. Not the least of
these was the class election, in which Julia and Ruth took
more part than in that of the preceding year. There
happened to be in their class about twenty girls from a
large preparatory school,&mdash;a public High School,&mdash;and
these girls had been a power at the Freshman elections.
Indeed, so certain was their ticket to be elected that the
rest of the class had put up few candidates. By this
second autumn, however, the situation had changed somewhat.
Girls like Julia and Ruth, who had entered with
none of the advantages of a backing of comrades, were
now pretty well known. The Freshman Class President
proved unpopular, and had shown so little special ability
that not even her personal friends favored her re-election.
Several were anxious to have Clarissa a candidate, and the
friends of Annabel Harmon intended to put her up.
Somewhat to Julia&rsquo;s surprise she found Ruth favoring
Annabel. The latter had been a Special, until late in the
year she had become a Freshman. Annabel was a pleasing
girl, able to talk eloquently on any subject,&mdash;so eloquently
that those who looked beneath the surface sometimes
doubted her knowledge of the things she talked the most
about. Julia, reproaching herself for unfairness, disliked
having Ruth so intimate with Annabel.</p>
<p>Julia championed Clarissa as a candidate, because she
saw that the Western girl was a born leader, and because
she admired her frank, open nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I object to Clarissa,&rdquo; Ruth had said, &ldquo;because she
makes so many foolish jokes. She doesn&rsquo;t seem to me to
represent the class properly. Now, Annabel is always dignified,
and college girls are so criticised that one who is
conspicuous ought to be conventional.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>Julia perceived that Ruth was already under Annabel&rsquo;s
influence. She was a year or two older than the average
Freshman. This was not due to lack of ability, but to
her having decided rather late on a college course. She
had entered at the beginning of February&mdash;just after the
mid-years in the winter before Ruth and Julia entered
Radcliffe. She was rather proud of having become a regular
Sophomore: and indeed for a girl of Annabel&rsquo;s rather
indolent disposition, this was something to be proud of.
Only a girl of her egotism would have aspired so early in
her career to become Class President. Julia felt almost
positive that Annabel could not succeed, but Annabel herself
knew better. She had begun to work for the office
the preceding year. What had been the meaning of the
little luncheons that she had given from time to time, to
which she had bidden not only her intimates, but those
girls most likely to be of use to her? As she was not a
Freshman then, they may not have suspected her motives;
but the little luncheons, and the lending of valuable books,
and the flattering letters written at just the right time, and,
above all, a manner which said to each one to whom she
was talking, &ldquo;You really are the cleverest girl in the class,
and I wish that other people had the good sense to find it
out,&rdquo;&mdash;all these things had done their work; and when
the ballots were counted, Miss Harmon was President, and
Clarissa Herter had no office. Ruth had been the only
candidate for Secretary, and the office of Vice-President
had gone to a Latin School girl. It couldn&rsquo;t be said that
there was much feeling over the election, or anything
approaching dissension. Yet two or three who, like Julia,
were dissatisfied felt that Annabel did not deserve so
marked an honor. The sharper-sighted had seen too much
of her wire pulling. Nevertheless, a little later when the
Sophomores had their class luncheon, even those who did
not especially like her had to admit that Annabel made a
charming presiding officer, and as toast mistress (though
the toasts were drunk only in cold water) she was, as the
newspapers might have said, &ldquo;particularly felicitous.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>Soon after the class luncheon the Sophomores gave the
Freshmen a dance in the Auditorium. Although girls
danced with girls and no masculine person was present
(except the youth who assisted in moving the furniture),
all said that they had enjoyed it as much as if it had been a
co-educational affair (this was Clarissa&rsquo;s general term for
the occasional affairs in which Harvard and Radcliffe
students mingled). Even Pamela was seen in some of the
square dances, with a pretty little Freshman. The principles
of the little Freshman as well as her ignorance of
waltzing prevented her dancing anything but the lancers
and Portland fancy. So while the others were whirling
in the waltz, or leaping through some of the more modern
dances, Pamela and the Freshman, in Clarissa&rsquo;s words,
&ldquo;carried on a desperate flirtation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>Prosperity had agreed with Pamela; she looked stronger,
and her cheeks had more color than formerly. Although
she still lived at Miss Batson&rsquo;s, and although the loud
colors of the furniture and the loud manners of the
boarders still grated on her nerves, she found the work
that she had to do less burdensome than in her Freshman
year. The money earned by her summer of tutoring
sufficed to pay more than half the tuition fee of her Sophomore
year; and to keep her young pupil up to the mark,
she had been engaged to go to him twice a week during
the school year. Thus all her tuition fees were more
than provided for. Although she had not secured the
scholarship on account of the number of competitors, an
allowance had been made her by the Students&rsquo; Aid Society.
She could thus see that she could make both ends meet for
the year, and as to the future, she felt sure that she could
provide for that when the time came. Pamela, though
always independent and persevering, since coming to
Cambridge had acquired a hopefulness formerly unknown.
To this extent, if in no other way, she had felt the broadening
influence of Radcliffe,&mdash;or shall we say of the
great University under whose shadow lies the woman&rsquo;s
college?</p>
<p>At the Open Idler, Pamela wore a pretty pale pink
gown of soft veiling, simply made, but extremely becoming.
Julia found it hard to get Pamela to accept this
simple gift. She had thought at first of a subterfuge, of
pretending that the gown had been made for her, and
that because of the dressmaker&rsquo;s mistake she had had to
discard it. But on second thought she decided that
frankness was the best. When she found that Pamela
had decided not to go to the Idler because she had no
suitable gown, she brought forward the one that she had
had made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How pretty it is! What an exquisite color, and so
simple!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Julia had responded, &ldquo;and it is for you! I
had it made because I knew that you couldn&rsquo;t possibly
attend to anything so frivolous, with all that you
have to do this year. If you do not wear it, it shall
hang in my closet until the moths eat it. Come try it
on!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>So almost before she realized what she was doing,
Pamela had arrayed herself in the pretty, soft, clinging
gown, and as she looked in the long mirror she hardly
recognized herself. &ldquo;If I could pay for it,&rdquo; she murmured,
&ldquo;if you would let me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; responded Julia, &ldquo;certainly, in five years
or twenty years, whenever you can do it as well as not, I
shall be happy to let you pay for it. Of course I would
rather make it a present. But if you prefer, I will accept
payment for it any time after five years&mdash;not before.
That will be so much clear gain for me. For if you
should not take the gown it would hang in my closet
until the moths had made way with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Julia, what nonsense!&rdquo; And then Pamela, though
seldom voluble, expressed her gratitude very warmly.
Hoping to pay for it in the future, she was very glad to
accept the gown; and Julia, observing Pamela so perfectly
at ease,&mdash;such wonders will good clothes work,&mdash;felt
more than repaid for her forethought.</p>
<p>This Open Idler of their Sophomore year happened
to be the first one for Julia and Ruth. They had not sent
many cards of invitation, but a few of their friends came
out from Boston, and pushed their way through crowds of
gaily gowned girls to the large room where the Sophomores
received their friends. Among these were Nora
and her mother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure, Julia, that it is safe to bring Nora here.
Already she has begun to talk about coming to college,
and what I have seen here to-night makes college life
seem too attractive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why &lsquo;too attractive&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Julia, I am one of those old-fashioned persons
who cannot quite see the wisdom of a college education
for girls. Of course I would not wish Nora to consider
her education finished simply because she has left school.
Indeed, I have had her continue several of her studies; but
she owes something to society, and college cuts a girl off
so from social life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we have social life here&mdash;and masculine society,
too,&rdquo; she concluded with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; responded Mrs. Gostar, glancing around
the room, in which Harvard students were almost as
numerous as Radcliffe girls. Standing in corners, seated
on divans, walking toward the refreshment tables, were
youths and maidens enjoying one another&rsquo;s society to the
same extent as if in a crowded ball-room. The walls were
bright with orange and white festoons,&mdash;the class colors.
A touch of crimson twined across the end of the room
where the year of the class was inscribed showed the
connection with Harvard. Rugs on the floor, tall palms
in the corners, great vases of primroses, and bands of
yellow ribbon on the refreshment tables, had transformed
the plain recitation room into a bower of beauty. Each
class had a room to itself, similarly decorated, and there
was one for the Specials. Downstairs the officers of the
Idler, the Dean of the college, and the Secretary received
the guests, who were introduced individually by ushers.
There was a table with refreshments in the parlor; there
were refreshments and an orchestra in the Auditorium;
there were, as Polly said, &ldquo;t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tes unlimited&rdquo; in the
Library and in the recitation rooms; and any one whose
knowledge of Radcliffe was obtained first through an
&ldquo;Open Idler&rdquo; would have pronounced it the most frivolous
of institutions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>Tom Hearst, now in the Law School, and one or two
other friends of Philip&rsquo;s accepted the invitations sent them
by Ruth and Julia. The latter would have liked to ask
some questions about Philip, for not a word had come to
her directly since that Class Day evening. He was in her
thoughts constantly, but she would not say a word.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<h2 id="c14">XIV
<br /><span class="small">IN DISGUISE</span></h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Learned Sophomores! full of information,</p>
<p class="t">&lsquo;Yes, we know it all,&rsquo; your manner seems to say.</p>
<p class="t0">Learned Sophomores! In each generation,</p>
<p class="t">Sophomores will be Sophomores in the same old way.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Thus under her breath Clarissa, from her seat in the
Auditorium, hummed a strain from a Radcliffe song. Girls
were gathering in the room to witness an Idler play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometime,&rdquo; said Clarissa, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be a Senior, and have
a front seat. But if you can&rsquo;t have the first, the fifth row
isn&rsquo;t so very bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While waiting for the play to begin, the girls in Clarissa&rsquo;s
neighborhood chatted gaily. The play had attracted many
of the Alumn&aelig;, because it was the work of a Radcliffe girl
who had been out of college a year or two. They waited
a little impatiently, for the Auditorium was really overcrowded,
with girls sitting on the steps and leaning on the
ledges of the windows leading into the conversation room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I do wish that they would begin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t girls ever do anything on time? It is <i>so</i>
uncomfortable sitting in this stuffy room!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>These and other murmurs came from various parts of
the Auditorium. It was certainly much past the hour, and
yet the curtain did not rise. At last the President came
forward. &ldquo;I must ask your indulgence,&rdquo; she said, as she
stood in front of the curtain. &ldquo;Something has gone
wrong with the curtain, we cannot raise it; but while we
are waiting for a carpenter, Miss Harmon has kindly
consented to read.&rdquo; At this there was much applause,
for Annabel had a well-trained voice, and sufficient self-confidence
to make whatever she did very effective.
Accordingly, she came forward attired in a white muslin
gown, pale blue sash, and a leghorn hat lined with blue.
She was to wear the costume in the play, and no one
could deny that it was most becoming. Annabel read in a
plaintive tone. She read old ballads and modern love
songs, two of each, and the audience applauded most
heartily. Then she tried a bolder flight, a dramatic monologue,
and still her hearers were enthusiastic. She bowed
her thanks, smiled, and then a movement of the curtain was
seen. Annabel stood there unconscious of anything but
the audience before her. There was a vigorous clapping
of hands from a distant corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that sounds like a man, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said a girl
behind Julia, leaning over toward her. Just then a huge
bunch of carnations fell at Annabel&rsquo;s feet with a heavy thud,
as if thrown by some one used to handling missiles. Again
Annabel smiled and courtesied, and again the audience
applauded, with one pair of hands sounding louder than
the rest.</p>
<p>Clarissa looked at her watch, and closed the cover with
a snap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea to have the play begin; we
didn&rsquo;t come to a reading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Idler President again appeared in front of the
curtain and said something to Annabel. The latter, smiling
pleasantly, opened a book. The curtain rose behind
her, with the stage set for the play; but she began to
read again, slowly and with great expression, while in the
background the heads of various girls were seen peering
from behind the scenes, evidently impatient for Annabel
to stop.</p>
<p>Some of the audience, with a sense of the ridiculous,
began to laugh, but Annabel was unconscious of everything
but the applause. She stood as if waiting an encore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a wonder,&rdquo; whispered Julia to Clarissa, &ldquo;that she
got the Class Presidency? I believe that she hypnotizes
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, she reads like&mdash;like&mdash;a bird,&rdquo; said Clarissa
magnanimously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t honestly say &lsquo;like an angel,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Julia,
and Clarissa shook her head.</p>
<p>How long this unpremeditated performance might have
continued no one can say. Before Annabel could recite
again the President came forward, announcing firmly that
the play was to begin. On Annabel&rsquo;s face as she withdrew
there was a decidedly aggrieved expression. Nevertheless,
when she appeared in the play she looked as cheerful as
her wont, and said her lines in a melodious voice. Ruth
was a middle-aged Englishwoman, with a becoming lace
cap. The girl who played a man&rsquo;s part wore high boots
and a long drab coat, the skirts of which came below the
tops of her boots.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>The setting was good, the dialogue bright, and the audience
at last dispersed with the feeling that the whole performance
had been a great success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was that tall girl who passed us?&rdquo; asked Julia,
when the play was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure I do not know, at least I did not notice her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always feel,&rdquo; Julia continued, &ldquo;as if all the Alumn&aelig;
are acquainted. But I can see that it would be hard for
them all to know one another. The girl that I speak of
was tall and rather awkward, and she pushed her way
through the crowd without speaking to a soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she may have been a friend of some one in the
play. Each was allowed to invite a guest from outside.
Somebody told me that Annabel Harmon thought that
they might have been permitted to ask men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, because she thought that she would look particularly
fetching. For a sensible girl, she is certainly almost
as vain as they make them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the objection to men spectators? The costumes
are harmless enough, compared with what they were in my
day,&rdquo; said the graduate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only that it&rsquo;s against the rule,&rdquo; replied a Junior. &ldquo;But
in <i>your</i> day the girls who played men&rsquo;s parts used to wear
real clothes, didn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>real</i> clothes,&rdquo; and all laughed at the undergraduate&rsquo;s
slip.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, men&rsquo;s real clothes,&rdquo; the graduate added, &ldquo;borrowed
usually from some brother or cousin at the University.
Really, some girls made up wonderfully like Harvard
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to have seen them. I hate our present
stage dress for men; it is neither ancient nor modern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet it&rsquo;s very <i>proper</i>!&rdquo; interposed Clarissa sarcastically.
She had just joined the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why was manly attire given up? Since only girls
saw the plays, it couldn&rsquo;t have done any great harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was a man who spoiled it all, you know; they
deserve their reputation of marplots. I can&rsquo;t vouch for the
story, but they say that a Senior who came once to an
Open Idler thought it necessary to express his gratification
to some one in authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one could find fault with that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but he was awkward. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m delighted to be here,&rsquo;
he said, &lsquo;for I&rsquo;ve often hoped to visit Radcliffe. My
clothes have been here many times at the Idler dramatics,
but this is the first opportunity that I have had for
coming myself.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a stupid creature!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it seems he had a sister in Radcliffe who was in
the habit of borrowing his clothes. He had a rather small
and neat figure, and a large wardrobe, so that he could be
drawn upon for almost any kind of dress. The rule, however,
was made immediately after this speech of his that
men&rsquo;s costumes were not to be worn at our performances,
and great was the lamentation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t as bad as it used to be,&rdquo; said another; &ldquo;we can
wear a kind of man&rsquo;s dress now, provided that the coat has
a skirt effect. It isn&rsquo;t exactly an up-to-date costume, but
it is fairly picturesque.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think,&rdquo; interposed Clarissa, in a tragic tone,
&ldquo;that at the Pudding plays, or indeed at the Cercle
Fran&ccedil;aise, or anything else at Harvard, the boys can put on
ballet costumes or any dress that a woman might or
mightn&rsquo;t wear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no equality of rights, even in so frivolous a
thing as theatricals,&rdquo; cried one of the girls in mock sorrow.
&ldquo;Why, Polly, why are you so late? You&rsquo;ve missed
some fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I had to go to the City this afternoon.
I suppose the play <i>was</i> fun. But I&rsquo;ve just seen something
quite as funny,&rdquo; and Polly began to smile at the
remembrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, tell us, Polly, for if there is anything funny to be
seen, you are sure to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I met a girl at the head of Garden Street smoking
a big meerschaum pipe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t funny, it&rsquo;s pathetic!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must have been ashamed, for when she saw me
she tried to put the pipe in her pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How ridiculous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she couldn&rsquo;t find the pocket, and so she started
to put the pipe back in her mouth. It was clear that
either she wasn&rsquo;t used to pipes&mdash;or to dresses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Polly!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;So I asked Frank Everton, who was with me&mdash;no, he
hadn&rsquo;t been in town with me, I only met him in the
Square&mdash;I asked him to follow her into the college
grounds. She crossed the street at a trot when she saw us
coming, and it seemed to me that she was making for
Weld Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the girls in the group were now thoroughly interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consequently I stood at the corner of Appian Way
until Frank came back with his report, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Polly paused to note the effect of her words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, what was it?&rdquo; asked the impatient listeners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was Loring Bradshaw. Frank followed him to
his room, where he tore off his skirts. He had forgotten
that he was masquerading as a woman when he lit his
pipe. You see it was in the pocket of the waistcoat which
he wore beneath his cape. I had recognized him almost
immediately; you know he has a funny little scar under his
eye, and then that manly stride! Even in Cambridge you
wouldn&rsquo;t see a girl with a gait like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why was he parading in woman&rsquo;s clothes? Was
it a college bet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I haven&rsquo;t heard the whole story yet. Frank came
back in a hurry because he had left me standing there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of a hat did he wear?&rdquo; asked Julia with
interest. &ldquo;Was it large and drooping, with yellow
roses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very hat. But I never knew you to take so
much interest in a mere hat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was the cape a black one, with a chenille collar?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he was here at the play. I wondered who she
was. But why in the world did he do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One afternoon soon after this, as Polly and Ruth loitered
in the hall they noticed a young man entering the
Secretary&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll find no one there,&rdquo; said Polly, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;ve just
been in myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stepping out of the office door, the visitor happened to
see Annabel Harmon crossing his path, and he stopped
her, apparently to ask a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder who he is,&rdquo; said Polly. &ldquo;Annabel will
think herself in luck if he asks her to show him the
building. She loves to act as guide, philosopher, and
friend to strangers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently some such duty had fallen on Annabel, for
she and the stranger ascended the stairs toward the
Library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; cried Polly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind Annabel&rsquo;s being
the chief usher at all our social functions, and presenting
herself everywhere as the typical Radcliffe girl. But the
rest of us know something about the building and its contents&mdash;including
the students. Why didn&rsquo;t that youth
ask us to show him over the building? In the Secretary&rsquo;s
absence, Annabel will be able to say whatever comes into
her head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you a little unfair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, but I&rsquo;ll run upstairs. Annabel might not
give us a perfectly impartial account. Won&rsquo;t you come?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; replied Ruth, &ldquo;I was on the point of
going home.&rdquo; So Ruth went home, and Polly mischievously
hastened up to the Library. She found Annabel and
the stranger looking apparently for some book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Polly,&rdquo; cried Annabel, &ldquo;<i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> you find the
Librarian? Mr. Radcliffe, excuse me. Mr. Radcliffe, let
me introduce you to Miss Porson.&rdquo; Polly started at the
name, while acknowledging the introduction, and Annabel
continued: &ldquo;Mr. Radcliffe is deeply interested in our
college on account of the name. You see he is descended
from the same family as our foundress, and he thinks that
it would be most interesting to establish some memorial
of the family here. Didn&rsquo;t I understand you to say that
you thought of giving a collection of books, or something
of that kind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Radcliffe modestly bowed his assent, for Polly broke
in before he had time to reply in words. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t exactly
call Anne Radcliffe our foundress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; and Annabel&rsquo;s smile was sweeter than ever,
&ldquo;the college certainly took its name from her, and it
seems so interesting to have one of her descendants
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly a descendant,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Radcliffe,
&ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, one of the family&mdash;it&rsquo;s almost the same thing
in these days when every one is so interested in
genealogy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>Although Annabel was always fluent, Polly looked at
her in surprise, for she was soon launched on a long account
of the origin, rise, and present condition of Radcliffe.
Mr. Radcliffe listened attentively, apparently with no inclination
to say more than &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Only fancy,&rdquo; and the other little things that keep conversation
from becoming entirely a monologue. Polly had
moved to one side, and from time to time she gave the two a
curious glance. Was it imagination, or did she really see
a smile on the young man&rsquo;s face?</p>
<p>Presently as they strolled into the hall, Polly heard
Annabel say, &ldquo;I am really sorry, Mr. Radcliffe, that we
have no books relating to your family. To-morrow, however,
when the Librarian is here she may find something.
Her assistant is rather new to the work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can assure you,&rdquo; the young man responded effusively,
&ldquo;I have been more than repaid for coming. To see
the interior of this building is indeed an experience, and
under such auspices!&rdquo; Annabel accepted the compliment
with a becoming blush. &ldquo;She always can blush to order,&rdquo;
one of her critics had been known to say.</p>
<p>Mr. Radcliffe&rsquo;s next remark was inaudible to Polly,
but Annabel&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Why, certainly, I will see what I can do,&rdquo;
rang out quite distinctly. Leaving the young man alone
for a moment, Annabel went into one of the smaller rooms
leading off the hall. In a few minutes she returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me for keeping you so long. I had some difficulty
in getting it,&rdquo; and she held out to Mr. Radcliffe a
slip of white paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you, thank you a thousand times; no book-plate
in my collection will be more valued than this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I declare,&rdquo; thought Polly, &ldquo;a book-plate for a
souvenir! Perhaps it&rsquo;s all right to give it to a descendant
of the Radcliffes as we haven&rsquo;t any relics of the immortal
Anne Radcliffe to show; but really, I wonder if Mr. Radcliffe
thinks that Annabel is President, Dean, and Secretary
all combined? It&rsquo;s a pity that he couldn&rsquo;t have come
at an hour when more of the powers could have been seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Polly reached the first floor of Fay House, Mr.
Radcliffe was no longer there, and Annabel, seated in the
conversation room, with a magazine before her on the
table, had her eyes fixed dreamily on space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thinking of Anne Radcliffe?&rdquo; queried Polly, as she
went by. But Annabel did not answer, and, passing on,
Polly met Clarissa at the outer door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such fun!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been laughing for
five minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; responded Polly, &ldquo;that I may laugh, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was crossing the Common I met my cousin
Archibald apparently waiting for some one. I stopped for
a second to speak to him, and of course I asked whom he
was waiting for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it seems that Somers Brown is up for one of
those Greek letter societies,&mdash;I&rsquo;ve forgotten which, and
part of the programme, the novitiate, or whatever they
call it, is for him to bring a book-plate away from the
Radcliffe Library by means of some bluff. He wasn&rsquo;t to
get it by breaking and entering, but he was to have it
freely given to him by some one in the college. So he
decided to rig up as an Englishman, and call himself a
descendant of Anne Radcliffe&rsquo;s family, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Polly, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then you saw him? Perhaps it was you who gave
him the book-plate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; replied Polly, &ldquo;although I had the pleasure of
meeting Mr. Radcliffe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely neither the Dean nor the Librarian gave it to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed! It was Annabel. He ran across her when
he started on his search for information. Poor Annabel,
she believed every word he said, although she prides herself
so on her insight. She gave him any amount of information
about Harvard as well as about Radcliffe. But then,
he really had an English accent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, but imagine Annabel&rsquo;s rage when she finds
that she has been imposed on! I shouldn&rsquo;t like to break
the news to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she ought to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it isn&rsquo;t our duty to tell her. Let us see what
happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The outcome was that Annabel the next morning was
ready to tell the Dean of the honor paid the college by the
visit of Mr. Radcliffe. &ldquo;He is willing to make researches
in England regarding Lady Moulson herself, and I should
not be surprised if he should found a scholarship for us.
From what he said I judge that he has a large estate in
England, and he seems deeply interested in Radcliffe,
especially after hearing my account of things.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>Julia happened to be the girl to whom Annabel had
begun to unfold her great expectations from Mr. Radcliffe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But haven&rsquo;t you heard the true story?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, what do you mean? What true story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Polly told me, she and Clarissa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annabel began to lose her usual placidity. She suspected
a practical joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, who was&mdash;that is, wasn&rsquo;t he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Julia, &ldquo;at least as I understand it, he
wasn&rsquo;t a Radcliffe. It was a test quiz, you know, for one
of the college societies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then who was the man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name was Brown, Somers Brown. He was ordered
to get some girl he didn&rsquo;t know to show him through Fay
House, and to bring away a new book-plate to prove that
he had been in the Library. At least that is as I understood
the story from Clarissa.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>It would have been better had Julia not mentioned
Clarissa&rsquo;s name. Annabel turned from white to red and
from red to white. Like most persons with a fair amount
of self-love, she regarded a practical joke as almost unbearable.
She remembered how Polly had stood about in the
hall while she was talking with the Englishman, and she
felt not unnaturally aggrieved. Beyond the change of
color and a certain increase of dignity, Annabel did not
express her feelings. &ldquo;When there is any mischief brewing
Polly and Clarissa are pretty sure to be in it,&rdquo; she said.
Then she moved off with a smile hardly less amiable than
the one she usually wore, before Julia could explain that
Polly and Clarissa had really had nothing to do with the
visit of the pseudo Mr. Radcliffe, to Fay House. The
story, however, had widely circulated, and most of those
who knew Annabel, even her friends, were highly entertained
that one who so prided herself on her insight should
have been thus imposed upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw Somers Brown walking about with Annabel yesterday,
and I wondered why he held up his hand as if to
enjoin silence on me. I had no idea that he was moving
about under false colors. I can see, though, how he might
impose on any one as an Englishman. He has lived
abroad a great deal, and he really has an accent. Now that
I think of it, his get-up yesterday was rather amusing, the
plaids in his suit were so very plaid, and he used his
monocle so steadily&mdash;and that cane!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is so well known in Boston and Cambridge society
that I wonder Annabel did not recognize him. I supposed
that she knew everybody&mdash;at least by sight,&rdquo; said one
girl, sarcastically.</p>
<p>But so far as words were concerned, no one ever knew
exactly how Annabel felt. An observer, however, might
have noticed that from this time her demeanor toward
Clarissa and Polly was far less cordial.</p>
<p>The book-plate episode led to a revival of interest in the
story of Anne Radcliffe. Girls who had never heard just
how the name came to be chosen for their college began to
inform themselves more exactly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<h2 id="c15">XV
<br /><span class="small">ANGELINA</span></h2>
<p>Late one afternoon as Julia sat in her study, the maid,
rapping at her door, announced, &ldquo;A young girl to see
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t she give her name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she is&mdash;well, she is a young person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show her up, please,&rdquo; and Julia, stepping outside,
soon saw Angelina coming up the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what brought you so far this cold day, Angelina?&rdquo;
she asked in greeting her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Miss Julia,&rdquo; she replied from the depths of an
easy-chair in which she had immediately seated herself,
&ldquo;well, I did have a time getting here. You see I started
this morning, and I told my mother not to worry if I
didn&rsquo;t come home to-night. I knew you&rsquo;d make room
for me, and there&rsquo;s things I want to talk over that I
couldn&rsquo;t write.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia had not heard from the Rosas since the Christmas
vacation, when she had spared a day to visit them and take
a basket of presents.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t sure that you wanted me to come to Cambridge,&rdquo;
said Angelina. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember your ever
inviting me, but ever since I heard you were at college
I&rsquo;ve been anxious to see what it was like. I thought that
colleges were just for men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, for girls, too, in these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d like to go to college myself,&rdquo; said Angelina,
with a sidelong glance at Julia, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t suppose
that I&rsquo;ll have the chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia shook her head. &ldquo;Angelina, you may not go to
college, but you know that we wish you to go on with your
studies. I am sorry that there is no evening school at
Shiloh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; responded Angelina, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just
what I wanted to talk about. I don&rsquo;t feel as if I cared
much for Shiloh; it&rsquo;s terribly quiet there in the winter
after the summer people are gone. I can&rsquo;t seem to think
that I want to stay there all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother must decide that. Are you not needed
at home?&rdquo; asked Julia weakly, knowing that Mrs. Rosa
had very little authority over her children, and that she
was only too ready to refer all difficult questions to Julia
and Miss South.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my mother <i>does</i> kind of depend on me,&rdquo; said
Angelina. She did not care to admit that she was of too
little consequence in the household. &ldquo;But still she <i>could</i>
get along without me. The boys help considerable after
school. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m appreciated; I&rsquo;m not perfectly
happy,&rdquo; and Angelina drew out her handkerchief,
to be ready for any tears that her self-pity might start.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot encourage you to leave Shiloh,&rdquo; said Julia.
&ldquo;You are not sixteen, and you are not strong enough, I
am sure, to go out to work. You would not find it half
as pleasant to work in a strange family as you find it now
at home; and should you get a place in town, you could
not possibly earn enough to pay your board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angelina applied the handkerchief to two or three
invisible tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Angelina,&rdquo; added Julia, &ldquo;I will do what I can.
I will write to Miss South. She can tell much better than
I what is best. You spoke about going to college. That,
at present, is out of the question. But is there any special
thing that you would like to study?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first Angelina made no reply. Then she replied
rather petulantly, &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of studying anything
in particular, only I don&rsquo;t care much to stay in Shiloh this
winter, and that&rsquo;s the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By her manner as well as by her words, Julia saw that
Angelina was likely to give her and Miss South more or
less trouble. They had assumed a certain responsibility
in regard to the Rosas, and they could not easily shake
it off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>During their two years in Shiloh the Rosas had seemed
to be contented. They had never before been so prosperous.
Instead of the two crowded tenement rooms they
had a neat little cottage, which had been put in perfect
order for them. In the course of the two years, to be
sure, the newness and freshness had decidedly worn off, as
Julia had observed to her regret when she called there in
December. But their Shiloh home was infinitely more
comfortable than any home they could have had in Boston.
Mrs. Rosa&rsquo;s health had failed in the city, but she had so
improved now that she was able to earn a fair part of the
family income. The rest of it was made up in various
ways. Miss South and Julia paid the rent of the little
house. Nora and Brenda and Edith had charge of a fund
made up of their own savings and contributions from their
friends. Since she had so cleverly recovered the money
stolen from Mrs. Rosa by Miguel Silva, Brenda felt that
she could be very liberal to the Rosas.</p>
<p>The fund was Mrs. Rosa&rsquo;s dependence for food and
fuel. Part of her fuel was gathered by the older children
in the woods, and a small vegetable garden supplied not
only summer vegetables, but something towards their
winter needs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>In season Angelina earned her board and a dollar a
week at a summer boarding-house. This she was allowed
to handle under Miss South&rsquo;s supervision, and she had already
started a bank-book. The sum in the bank, however,
was very small, for Angelina had availed herself to the
utmost of Miss South&rsquo;s permission to use part of her own
money for clothes. Suitable garments were chosen each
year by Brenda and her friends from their own stock of
discarded clothes, which, altered, answered for Angelina.
But shoes and hats and some other things Angelina
insisted on buying from her own savings, and in consequence
the amount in the bank showed small increase.
Mrs. Rosa herself had once worked at tailoring, and so she
was able to remodel the garments given her for her boys.
In the case of so helpless a family, neither Miss South nor
Julia felt that they were likely to do harm by fairly liberal
gifts. They had removed Mrs. Rosa from the city where
she might have had regular relief from various charitable
societies, from her church and from the Overseers if
from no more. They had made her understand that all
that she received from private individuals was conditioned
on the care she showed in bringing up her family,&mdash;that
it was a kind of reward of merit. Thus far all the people
interested in the Rosas had been gratified by their progress,
and Julia knew that Miss South had some plans for
Angelina which might make the girl more contented.
Ever since summer, however, Miss South had been occupied
with the care of her aged grandmother, Madame
Dulaunay, and she had been unable to do more for the
Rosas than write to them and see that they received their
money regularly. That very week she had started for
Florida with Madame Dulaunay, and Julia saw she must
make plans for Angelina. She was beginning to be so
busy now preparing for the examinations that she hardly
saw how she could spare much thought or energy for the
young girl. Behind these thoughts was a background
of disappointment that Angelina had so quickly tired of
Shiloh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must tell me what you especially wish to do, or
to study,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m,&rdquo; responded Angelina, too much interested in
a box of photographs on the table to reply with her usual
loquacity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there <i>is</i> something?&rdquo; Julia questioned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, nothing in particular. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind living
at the North End again. It&rsquo;s livelier than Shiloh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely,&rdquo; said Julia, &ldquo;you are all much more comfortable
at Shiloh than you could possibly be at the North
End.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; rejoined Angelina. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel so
very comfortable at Shiloh. I ain&rsquo;t busy enough, and I
ain&rsquo;t idle enough really to enjoy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia understood Angelina, poorly though she had
expressed her meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does your mother know where you are to-night?
Won&rsquo;t she be worried if you stay away so late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told her that I was coming to Cambridge to see you.
She&rsquo;ll know that you will look out for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you next come to Cambridge you must start
earlier. It is altogether too late for you to go home now.
I will have a bed made for you on this divan, and to-morrow
you can go back to Shiloh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you,&rdquo; cried Angelina, her face beaming at
the thought of a night away from Shiloh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll tell you, Angelina, what I propose to do.
I will see if your mother will let you come to Cambridge
once a week. There is one day when I am not very
busy. I can probably arrange to have you sleep in this
house. I will pay your way over here and give you your
meals. In return I shall expect you to do whatever
mending Miss Roberts and I have ready for you. Besides,
I will give you a lesson to study at home, and each
Wednesday I will hear you recite it and show you how to
study.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>Angelina both looked and spoke her thanks. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
see how you ever came to think of anything so beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad that you like it,&rdquo; responded Julia, &ldquo;and I
hope that you will do your best to help carry it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angelina chose history as her subject of study, and as
she had had American History at school, Julia began with
a little outline of the World&rsquo;s History.</p>
<p>It was a good plan and it worked very well. Shiloh
evidently had not given Angelina enough to do in winter,
and it was well for her to have an interest outside her
home. Yet her mother needed her help to a certain
extent, and it would have been a mistake to encourage
Angelina to work entirely outside of the house. The
weekly visit kept Julia in closer touch with the Rosa
family than would otherwise have been possible, and this
in itself was a good thing. Then, too, she gained deeper
insight into Angelina&rsquo;s character than she could have
gained in any other way.</p>
<p>She engaged a small room from Mrs. Colton where
Angelina slept when in Cambridge, and in it she placed a
wicker-work table with a large basket and all the appliances
for mending stockings, sewing on buttons, and the
simple repairing of which Angelina was capable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have always heard,&rdquo; said Ruth, who shared in the
advantages of Angelina&rsquo;s services, &ldquo;that lazy people take
the most pains; for, honestly, it would save you time and
money to do your own mending, and let me do mine,
rather than have all this bother with Angelina.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a good thing for me, too,&rdquo; replied Julia.
&ldquo;Our great danger here in college is in thinking that we
have no duties except those connected with our studies,
as if the only thing worth living for were to get &lsquo;A&rsquo; or
&lsquo;B&rsquo; in some course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know girls who wouldn&rsquo;t think &lsquo;B&rsquo; worth living
for,&rdquo; retorted Ruth, &ldquo;but I agree with you that there is
always a danger that we may be too narrow in our interests.
That&rsquo;s why I am glad that so many girls are taking
an interest in the operetta. In doing it they will be
assisting the fund for the North End reading-room, which
is calculated to do an immense amount of good. You
have no idea, Julia, what a success the operetta will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo; Julia spoke absent-mindedly. A plan
that Miss South had suggested for Angelina and girls of
her kind was running through her mind. But she knew
that until she should leave college there would be little
chance of carrying it into effect. She would have been
glad to work with some of the organized charities, but
she felt that college must claim the most of her time.
Comparatively few of her classmates, however, were without
some bit of philanthropic work. Several taught
Sunday-school classes. Several others gave an evening
a week to some Boys&rsquo; or Girls&rsquo; Club in Boston or Cambridge.
The Emmanuel Society, so named for John Harvard&rsquo;s
College, had regular meetings before which appeared
various organizations, who made clear their claims to the
support of thoughtful young women. The College Settlements
appealed strongly to the undergraduate, and a
chapter to raise money for the work had been formed at
Radcliffe. The Emmanuel Society supported an annual
scholarship, and maintained a library of text-books to be
lent to students who could not afford to buy all the expensive
books needed in their courses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>Julia and Ruth and Clarissa, and even Pamela, contributed
something to the various causes that appealed to
Radcliffe girls, for time as well as money was asked for.</p>
<p>When her aunt remonstrated with Julia for giving too
much thought and time to Angelina, Julia replied that
she believed that the time would not be altogether thrown
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that I know that Angelina needs help and advice,
I should feel it wrong to give her up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she appreciates it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Barlow doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure that she will,&rdquo; responded Julia cheerfully.
&ldquo;Besides, she really is of some use to me and
Ruth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet there were times when Angelina&rsquo;s little vagaries
were hard to overcome. She was, for example, very fond
of newspaper reading, and the advertisements seemed to
have a special charm for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Julia,&rdquo; she said one day, &ldquo;I do wish that
I could have a bottle of this,&rdquo; and she pointed to an
advertisement of &ldquo;The Pearl of Beauty.&rdquo; &ldquo;They say,&rdquo;
continued Angelina, &ldquo;that it will make the sallowest complexion
a delicate pink. Now, Miss Julia, you know that
I&rsquo;m as sallow as most Portuguese, and I do wish that
&lsquo;The Pearl of Beauty&rsquo; did not cost so much; it&rsquo;s a
dollar a bottle. But one of the boarders at Shiloh asked
me last summer if I wasn&rsquo;t a colored person&mdash;kind of
light-colored, and that wasn&rsquo;t pleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>But Julia, unmoved by this, explained that it was unwise
to believe every newspaper advertisement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look at this,&rdquo; pointing to the lithographed lady
who held a placard in her hands on which were printed
words of praise of the beautifier. &ldquo;&lsquo;Look at me, please.
I once was dark as night, but now am fair as a lily of
the valley.&rsquo; That shows that she must have improved,&rdquo;
said the confiding Angelina, reading the closing words:
&ldquo;&lsquo;Beauty is a duty.&rsquo; Oh! I wish that I could have a
bottle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be throwing money away, and I should be
very much displeased with you. Remember,&rdquo; added
Julia, &ldquo;that advertisements are written simply to induce
people to buy the thing advertised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they tell the truth?&rdquo; and Angelina looked
utterly surprised. &ldquo;I always believe every word I read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a great deal to learn, Angelina, and I do
hope that you will remember what I have said about
patent medicines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One Wednesday, a week or two later, Julia found
Angelina standing before the mirror in the little room
with a bottle in her hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; she asked, suspecting the
truth, and Angelina, starting guiltily, dropped the bottle,
and a pinkish fluid poured out on the light carpet. As
the bottle lay there, Julia read the words &ldquo;Pearl of
Beauty&rdquo; on the outside. Angelina shamefacedly seized
a towel and began to mop up the carpet, murmuring as
she did so, &ldquo;I bought it with my own money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Realizing that she had little authority over Angelina,
Julia could only say, &ldquo;I am sorry that you have so little
regard for my opinion.&rdquo; Yet neither then nor at any
other time did Angelina apologize for what she had done.
When Julia, consequently, reflected on the matter, she
wondered if, after all, she might not have made a mistake
in showing so much confidence in Angelina.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<h2 id="c16">XVI
<br /><span class="small">WHO WROTE IT?</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad taste, anyway,&rdquo; said Annabel Harmon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To call it by no worse name,&rdquo; responded Elizabeth
Darcy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost nothing can be worse than bad taste,&rdquo; rejoined
Annabel.</p>
<p>The two girls, at a table in the conversation room, were
looking eagerly at the page of a newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; asked Polly, who had
been standing near the window. &ldquo;Has anybody had the
bad taste to commit a murder, or burglary, or some other
crime? I see that you have a yellowish journal there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two, absorbed in their paper, did not reply, and
Polly drew near them until she could read the headlines:
&ldquo;Is a College Education Worth While for Girls?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Lowering of the Standard by a University Professor
to meet the Demands of Woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; cried Polly, &ldquo;this does look interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; responded Annabel, &ldquo;read further and you will
find it more so. You can take the paper for a few minutes.
I&rsquo;m glad that I happened to buy one in the Square
when I came out from town.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>Polly sat down with the newspaper. Under the large
headlines were others in smaller type that showed that the
professor to whom reference was made was a Harvard
professor, and then she began to read. Surely there was
something very familiar in what followed. It purported
to be the transcript of a few pages from the history note-book
of a student at Radcliffe. It was all very familiar.
Why, of course! Clarissa&rsquo;s notes! No one who had ever
gazed upon them could mistake the style. She remembered
having read this very lecture last year when preparing
for her examinations. Clarissa was always generous
in lending her note-books, and Polly had had the use of
this for a day or two. But what had seemed only funny
within the covers of a note-book seemed very impertinent
thus exposed to the gaze of every one who cared
to buy a penny paper. Reading further, Polly learned
that the article was copied from an obscure magazine to
which the Radcliffe notes had been sent with a plaintive
inquiry whether such lectures could greatly benefit
woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Professor Z!&rdquo; sighed Polly. &ldquo;He certainly
lectures in this style sometimes. For my own part, I
used to enjoy the colloquialisms, and he used to give us
so much besides that it isn&rsquo;t fair to pillory him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of Clarissa now?&rdquo; asked Elizabeth
Darcy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clarissa?&rdquo; repeated Polly. &ldquo;What has she to do
with it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>Elizabeth shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;Most of us have
seen Clarissa&rsquo;s note-books; if she didn&rsquo;t write this, who
did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say that this is not Clarissa&rsquo;s style, I won&rsquo;t
even say that these are not her notes; but I will say that
she didn&rsquo;t print them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish that I had your confidence in Clarissa.&rdquo; Elizabeth
spoke with an accent of pity. &ldquo;You must admit that
she loves to make fun of people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is not half as bad as I am,&rdquo; rejoined Polly, stoutly
defending her friend. &ldquo;Why, I have even made fun of
her,&mdash;that was before I knew her so well. But she bore
me no malice. In fact, she never takes revenge, and there
is malice in this article.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You admit that these are Clarissa&rsquo;s notes, and yet you
don&rsquo;t think them malicious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last speaker was Annabel, who had joined the
group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Miss Harmon, be fair; it is one thing to write
nonsense intended only for one&rsquo;s own eyes, and another to
put it before the public. Clarissa, I know, did not have
the notes published.&rdquo; Then Polly turned away.</p>
<p>Polly was by no means comfortable as she left Fay
House, and the better to disprove the accusation made by
Elizabeth, she went to the stationer&rsquo;s in the Square to buy
a copy of the newspaper. It was the last one to be had.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been in the greatest demand,&rdquo; explained the attendant.
&ldquo;Some kind of a college article, I believe; I haven&rsquo;t
had time to look at it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>Polly folded the paper and walked down Brattle Street.
&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ll ask Clarissa point blank.&rdquo; Polly had a
slightly uncomfortable doubt as she thought of the article,
and it happened, as it so often does happen in such cases,
that when she met Clarissa she could not ask the question.
&ldquo;If she hasn&rsquo;t heard, it would only disturb her,&rdquo; was her
excuse. Afterwards she was sorry that she had not at
once gone to her.</p>
<p>Within twenty-four hours almost every one at Radcliffe
had read the article. Those who did not own papers
borrowed them, and the critics and partisans of Clarissa
ranged themselves strongly on one side or the other.
Some, while blaming Clarissa for letting her notes get into
print, said that it was no more than Professor Z deserved,
since the tone of his lectures had never been sufficiently
academic. Others were glad that he was now absent on
his Sabbatical year, for if he were lecturing in Cambridge
they were sure that his wrath would have been pretty
keenly felt. Ruth, of course, took Annabel Harmon&rsquo;s
view of the affair. Julia, while loath to think that Clarissa
had done this in a spirit of malice, thought that she
had allowed herself to be carried away by the spirit of fun,
without realizing that the whole thing was a deflection
from the straight line of honor. She and Pamela discussed
the matter at some length, and very quickly agreed
that the relation of a professor to a small class was a confidential
relation, and that only an instructor who was on
very good terms with his class would talk to them after
the fashion of Professor Z. Consequently, to quote his
direct language was like telling family secrets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>Yet with it all nobody dared speak to Clarissa. They
quoted what this professor or that professor&rsquo;s wife had
said; how one had declared that nothing would induce
him to lecture at Radcliffe, how another had termed this
the natural result of trying to benefit women,&mdash;they
would merely hold up their benefactors to ridicule,&mdash;and
still no one dared reprove Clarissa. The Western girl
wrapped herself in a forbidding manner, and not even
Polly dared speak of the article or its effects.</p>
<p>But one day, turning the matter over in her mind, she
came to a decision. &ldquo;A party will be the very thing,&rdquo;
she said to herself, &ldquo;and Clarissa shall give it. Ruth and
Julia and Lois Forsaith, oh, yes, and Pamela, and two or
three others,&mdash;as many as she can afford chairs for,&mdash;it
will be the very thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clarissa&rsquo;s room was in a small, neat house in a neat side
street. Her landlady had other boarders, but she took a
real interest in them all.</p>
<p>Clarissa&rsquo;s room looked on a little yard filled with pear
trees, and the children of the neighborhood played constantly
under her windows. This did not disturb her, for
her nerves were not near the surface. Sometimes she
called the children to her room and gave them a treat of
fruit or sweet things. Mrs. Freeman&rsquo;s other boarders
thought Clarissa rather frivolous. One of them was a
timid Freshman who studied unremittingly. Two of the
others were graduate students, delving into zo&ouml;logy, and
other &ldquo;mussy sciences&rdquo; (Clarissa&rsquo;s phraseology), and the
fifth was an inoffensive Sophomore. The two graduates
roomed together. Clarissa had the best room in the
house, but the Freshman had a small room under the
eaves. The Freshman sometimes complained that she had
made a mistake, and that she should have had a room in a
lodging-house where she could have boarded herself with
the aid of a chafing-dish and gas stove.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>&ldquo;And starve to death, with nobody nigh to hinder,&rdquo;
said Clarissa. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad that kind of thing is not encouraged
at Radcliffe. But I wish that you had the room
on my floor, instead of those zo&ouml;logists. Often about ten
<span class="small">P.M.</span> when I&rsquo;ve finished studying I&rsquo;d slip in and talk
with you. Sometimes I knock on the zo&ouml;logical door,
but if they let me in I feel like a criminal, for I can see
that they are making a great effort to be polite, while they
wish me a thousand miles away. They like to study well
into the small hours, but as they pay for their own oil
nobody can well object. I&rsquo;m not half as entertaining to
them as those squirmy things they keep in bottles. The
only real gaiety in which they ever indulge is an ethical
discussion with Pamela; just imagine the combination,
ethics and zo&ouml;logy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other girl laughed. &ldquo;You might start a discussion
at your party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you, it&rsquo;s to be a poster party, nothing
more nor less improving than posters will be considered
worthy of mention.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>Clarissa had yielded to Polly&rsquo;s plans for the party,
understanding the spirit in which it had been arranged.
It had been talked of indefinitely before the affair of the
newspaper; and although Polly did not now explain why
she was so anxious to have her friend turn entertainer at
this particular time, Clarissa understood, and Polly knew
that she understood.</p>
<p>Nearly all who had been invited responded to Clarissa&rsquo;s
invitation, and one windy evening they gathered very
contentedly around the open fire in her room. Clarissa&rsquo;s
room was as different as possible from Julia&rsquo;s. To its
rather homely furnishings she had added various things
that had caught her fancy without regard to any scheme
of art. There was a vivid Navajo blanket over her couch,
and two Indian baskets from the Southwest on a bracket
in a corner. Some Japanese fans were displayed over the
mantle-piece, and just above them hung in a black frame
a fine photograph of the Arch of Titus. But the other
three walls, whether beautiful or ugly in the matter of
their everyday decorations, for this evening were hidden
by posters&mdash;posters large, small, ugly, beautiful, covered
every spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Clarissa, in explanation, after welcoming
her guests, &ldquo;I know that posters have gone out of
fashion. That is partly why I&rsquo;ve taken them up. I had
thought of offering prizes to the girl who could guess the
artist of the largest number, but instead of that I&rsquo;m going
to explain them myself. Lo! here is a pointer that I
brought over from Fay House this very afternoon.&rdquo; So
armed with the long wooden stick, Clarissa moved about
the room, explaining much after the fashion of an auctioneer
who has something to dispose of.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">
<img src="images/pic3.jpg" alt="&ldquo;Clarissa moved about the room, explaining&rdquo;" width="500" height="786" />
<p class="center">&ldquo;Clarissa moved about the room, explaining&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;This you will see is undoubtedly French. You could
tell it by the anatomy of the cats, if in no other way.
Such creatures were never seen on this side of the Atlantic.
Jim got it for me. The real name of the work of
art is &lsquo;Lait Pur Sterilis&eacute;;&rsquo;&rdquo; and as she paused for a moment,
they all gazed with fitting admiration on the child
in a red dress drinking from a bowl under the envious
eyes of three cats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; said Polly, &ldquo;than some of those
greenery yallery things. No wonder Aubrey Beardsley
died young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Polly, you artless creature, didn&rsquo;t you dote on
the Yellow Book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; replied Polly. &ldquo;I measured Mrs. Patrick
Campbell as once portrayed there, and in proportion to
the length of her head as there shown she must be about
ten feet tall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Polly, I didn&rsquo;t realize that you knew so much
about Art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know more things than I am sometimes credited
with,&rdquo; and there was an undertone of deeper meaning in
Polly&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a Grasset,&rdquo; continued Clarissa, resuming her
explanations. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a beauty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Clarissa,&rdquo; said Julia, &ldquo;I like this better;&rdquo; and
rising, she put her hand on a poster with a Puritan maiden
carrying mistletoe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;You show your taste,&rdquo; said Clarissa, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a Rhead.&rdquo;
Though hung near Dudley Hardy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gaiety Girl&rdquo; in
poster land, the two did not seem inharmonious neighbors.
Not far from them was Bemliardt&rsquo;s Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc, and
for fifteen minutes or more Clarissa kept her friends
amused with the poster show. Before her art lecture was
quite at an end, Julia as assistant hostess had lit the lamp
under the chafing-dish, and then when the others found
that fudge-making was the next thing on the programme,
each one wished to offer her own receipt, and to the great
surprise of the company it was found that each receipt
varied a little from the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First you grate a pound of chocolate into the chafing-dish,&rdquo;
began Polly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not a pound&mdash;half a pound at first,&rdquo; interrupted
Julia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great deal better to begin by melting your
butter, and then put in a pint of milk,&rdquo; added Ruth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never use any milk,&rdquo; interposed Clarissa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you let it simmer half an hour,&rdquo; resumed
Polly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there isn&rsquo;t any fixed length of time,&rdquo; cried Ruth
again; &ldquo;just let it cook until it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know when it&rsquo;s done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then followed a Babel of voices, as each one told what
she thought the proper test; and a listener, I fear, who
knew nothing of fudge-making, would have had hard
work to select a working receipt from the directions given
by these merry girls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>By the time the fudge was ready the ball had been set
rolling, and it was evident that Clarissa&rsquo;s party was a
success. While Ruth and Lois were superintending a
second chafing-dish, in which a rarebit was preparing,
Polly picked up a guitar and began to accompany herself,
as she sang the opening lines of one of the Radcliffe
classics, &ldquo;The Mermaid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the thing to cheer us up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if you needed cheering! But here it is!&rdquo; And
Polly struck the chords with a firm hand, as she sang
about the little mermaid who</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Could not even speak Acroparthianic Greek,</p>
<p class="t0">And she&rsquo;d no instruction in Theology.</p>
<p class="t0">One day she found, as she swam around,</p>
<p class="t0">A Radcliffe catalogue,</p>
<p class="t0">Which shone afar like an evening star</p>
<p class="t0">From out the mist and fog.</p>
<p class="t0">She paused to rest on a billow&rsquo;s crest,</p>
<p class="t0">In a wreath of sparkling foam,</p>
<p class="t0">And when she had read what the catalogue said,</p>

<p class="t0">And ought to go to college.</p>
<p class="t0">So dressed in her best with a hat from C&eacute;leste,</p>

<p class="t0">The cars were so filled she was almost killed,</p>
<p class="t0">But she found she could easily swim</p>
<p class="t0">Up Garden Street, that road so neat</p>
<p class="t0">That has Radcliffe on its brim.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The last two lines were loudly applauded, for the mud
of Garden Street was constantly ridiculed by the college
girls to be beyond description. The song proceeded to
describe the advent of the mermaid at Fay House:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;She told her race, and her boarding-place,</p>
<p class="t0">And her age (less a year, maybe),</p>
<p class="t0">But when the question came,</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;What&rsquo;s your grandma&rsquo;s middle name?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t0">She wept and turned to flee.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The regular Boston question,&rdquo; said Clarissa, with an
expression of scorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt,&rdquo; cried Ruth, as Polly sang the chorus
of each verse.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Oh, the ocean swell is all very well</p>
<p class="t0">For frivolous sport and play,</p>
<p class="t0">But the cultured mind you&rsquo;ll seldom find</p>
<p class="t0">Beneath the salt sea spray.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Other songs followed this,&mdash;the &ldquo;Hunting Song&rdquo; from
the &ldquo;Princess Perfection,&rdquo; snatches from one or two
real operas; and at last as they sat around the open fire
drinking lemonade&mdash;for the rarebit was now a thing of
the past&mdash;Clarissa turned down the lights, and proposed
that they should tell weird stories. No one of the eight
or nine present was excused. Even Ernestine Dunton
had to do her part, and she had unbent to an extent that
was astonishing to Ruth and Clarissa; for in the preceding
year when she had been their Senior adviser, she had
seemed the personification of seriousness. She was now
back at Radcliffe as a graduate student, and in certain
ways she had begun to unbend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>As her friends bade her good-night, Clarissa knew
that her party had been a success; for Polly, lingering
a little behind the others, put out her hand and
whispered, &ldquo;You know that we don&rsquo;t believe that you
did that foolish thing, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; and Clarissa, returning
the pressure, replied, &ldquo;Of course you could not
believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<h2 id="c17">XVII
<br /><span class="small">A PRIVATE DETECTIVE</span></h2>
<p>In spite of the surface frivolity, there was in Polly a
strong vein of common sense. Therefore, as she thought
more and more deeply about the newspaper article she
became convinced that great injustice had been done
Clarissa. She was naturally puzzled, for the notes so
unkindly quoted were certainly from the Kansas girl&rsquo;s
note-book. Only too well she remembered having read
them herself, and having laughed at some of the hits.
But how had the newspaper obtained them? Without
having talked with Clarissa directly, without having had
more than the whispered word at the party, she yet knew
that the Kansas girl was not to blame. She began to set
her wits at work. To solve the mystery she must turn
private detective.</p>
<p>One Wednesday afternoon she dropped into the pleasant
drawing-room at Fay House; &ldquo;the most homelike place,&rdquo;
she often said, &ldquo;this side of Atlanta.&rdquo; Indeed, many
other Radcliffe girls were in the habit of saying the same
thing, only instead of Atlanta they named Pittsburg, or
Topeka, or Kalamazoo, or, in short, the particular city or
town which each called her home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;The first month I was in Cambridge,&rdquo; Polly had said
to the President, &ldquo;I was right smart homesick and miserable.
I felt like I couldn&rsquo;t stand it. But when I came in
here, and saw you seated at the tea-table, beside the open
fire, I felt like I were with my grandmother, and that
this was a place where I could lay aside all my forlornness.
You don&rsquo;t mind my comparing you to my grandmother?
I reckon it isn&rsquo;t perfectly polite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the widow of the great scientist, who was proud to
admit her threescore years and ten, smiled with her accustomed
grace, saying in reply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, my dear, I am only complimented by the
comparison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor was Polly the only one who felt the restful influence
of the drawing-room at Fay House; the quaint
old-fashioned room, with its oval ends, curving outward,
with its dull green satiny wall-paper, and the old-time
couch and easy-chairs covered in flowered crimson.</p>
<p>Girls who entered it for the first time were impressed by
the dainty silver and china of the tea-table, and they would
turn from the life-size portrait of Mrs. Agassiz between
the windows to the majestic figure of the President herself
presiding over the teacups, and neither picture nor
living figure suffered by the comparison.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>On this particular Wednesday afternoon, not so very long
after the publication of the alleged lecture of Professor Z
in the yellow journal, Polly, after paying her respects
to Mrs. Agassiz, seated herself at the further side of the
room. She did not linger as was her wont around the tea-table,
for two distinguished guests had entered just behind
her. One was a Frenchwoman, of international reputation,
and the other a distinguished Englishman, making a study
of our institutions. The former was accompanied by a
well-known member of the Harvard Faculty, and the latter
by two Bostonians whom he was visiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it just lovely,&rdquo; said a little Freshman seated
near Polly, &ldquo;to see such great people? That&rsquo;s what I like
about Boston and Cambridge. You&rsquo;re always meeting
people who seem to belong in books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Polly mockingly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a liberal education
just to look at them. Let&rsquo;s talk French, and see if our
accent improves through breathing the same atmosphere
with Madame X.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t mean exactly that,&rdquo; replied the Freshman,
&ldquo;only we certainly <i>do</i> learn things here that we
couldn&rsquo;t get out of books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, dear, you&rsquo;re certainly right, and I only wish
that we could get yon Englishman to tell us how he
manages to wear that monocle, and yet look perfectly
happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Freshman glanced at Polly to see if she was in
earnest, and made some remark to which Polly returned
no answer.</p>
<p>Polly&rsquo;s thoughts indeed had begun to wander, sent off by
a word or two from a girl standing with her back to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t found it out yet, or she wouldn&rsquo;t speak to
her,&rdquo; were the words that fell on her ear. Looking toward
the door she saw that Clarissa had just entered, and had
paused for a moment to say a word to Annabel, who as
usual was the centre of an admiring group.</p>
<p>Clarissa passed on to pay her respects to the President;
and while Polly was reflecting on what she had heard,
she saw the girls in the group leave Annabel one by one to
join Clarissa, standing at the other side of the fireplace.
Annabel frowned as she moved toward Polly&rsquo;s corner.
She and the girl with her did not notice Polly, for they
stood with their backs to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is rather bold&mdash;really very bold, but she
never cares what any one thinks. She has so much&mdash;so
much&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Effrontery, I should call it,&rdquo; replied the other, who
was well known to be a worshipper of a rising star, such
as Annabel was now supposed to be. &ldquo;But I know that
you never like to say anything disagreeable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course, one should be very careful;&rdquo; and
Annabel sighed the sigh of the needlessly perfect person.</p>
<p>Upon this, Polly, rising suddenly, faced around, and with
a hasty nod to Annabel joined Clarissa at the other side of
the room.</p>
<p>The few apparently unimportant words that she had
heard had helped her far along with her detective work.
She could not, however, altogether conceal her feelings,
and slipping her arm through Clarissa&rsquo;s, she led her back
toward Annabel and her friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold the rising star!&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;for of
course,&rdquo; she added in explanation, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve heard that
Clarissa is to have leading part in Julia&rsquo;s operetta.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Polly,&rdquo; said Clarissa, &ldquo;I had not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t contradict,&rdquo; responded Polly, &ldquo;our plans are
made, and there isn&rsquo;t a question but that you have the
most manly tone, and gait, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Annabel, I thought that you were to have the
chief part!&rdquo; interposed her friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;ll be in it,&rdquo; rejoined Polly, in a somewhat
patronizing tone, assumed for the occasion, &ldquo;if not in the
chief part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she moved away, still leaning on Clarissa&rsquo;s arm,
and Annabel had no chance to retort. The foreign guests
had gone to inspect the other parts of Fay House, and the
drawing-room was filling with girls whose lectures for the
day had ended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Polly,&rdquo; cried Clarissa, as the two friends left the
room, after paying their respects to the President and Dean.
&ldquo;Why, Polly, I can&rsquo;t act; I don&rsquo;t belong with those girls at
all. Ruth Roberts, you know, barely tolerates me, and
she&rsquo;s to be the manager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, she isn&rsquo;t the whole thing. Besides, I happen
to know that she <i>does</i> want you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Annabel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can&rsquo;t really leave her out. Her voice isn&rsquo;t
remarkable, but she acts pretty well; and since she&rsquo;s been
playing with the Cambridge Dramatic Club, she&rsquo;s been
considered our representative actor. Besides, she&rsquo;s a great
friend of Ruth&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; responded Clarissa. &ldquo;You surely ought to
have Annabel; but can I pull all right with those girls?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, and I am to be a dapper little dandy.
Though we are to be rivals in love, we can support each
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So at last Clarissa yielded, and after the mid-years, rehearsals
went on pretty rapidly. There were, after all,
several good parts in the operetta; and Ruth, viewing
everything with the critical eye of a business manager, was
certain that the performance would bring even more than
she had hoped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clarissa herself wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad,&rdquo; said Ruth one
evening, as she and Julia sat in the study after dinner,
&ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t say that I like her friends. She has a rather
scrubby lot of hangers-on. Look at those two this afternoon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I saw nothing to criticise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never do, Julia, but they certainly hadn&rsquo;t a word
to say for themselves, and their clothes were frightful.
Clarissa&rsquo;s red coat is bad enough, but she is rather fine-looking,
and she is so decidedly unlike any one else that
you don&rsquo;t have to apologize for her. But those others
were so&mdash;so nondescript.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruth,&rdquo; exclaimed Julia, with a shade of reproach, &ldquo;you
have changed very much the past year. You used to think
Belle&rsquo;s exclusiveness silly, but you are tending that way
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not in earnest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, you&rsquo;ll never be just like Belle. But you
have begun to think too much about appearances.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you are too amiable, Julia. As we can&rsquo;t be intimate
with all the girls we meet, we might as well choose
the most congenial. We can&rsquo;t let all kinds of girls take
up our time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My time isn&rsquo;t so valuable. I can spare a little even
to all kinds of girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but even on Mondays, sometimes, there are such
queer girls. They make an unfavorable impression on
people from town who call. Don&rsquo;t you remember when
Mrs. Blair came out? Now, if she had only met Annabel
Harmon or Elizabeth Darcy, how different it would have
been!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Annabel Harmon!&rdquo; Julia wondered why she so disliked
Ruth&rsquo;s intimacy with Annabel, for Annabel was a
popular girl, hardly less so than Elizabeth Darcy. She
was well-bred and interesting. &ldquo;I never can thoroughly
trust any one who spends her spare time reading French
books,&rdquo; Clarissa had said laughingly, although Julia would
have hesitated to put it quite so definitely.</p>
<p>Ruth, however, was apparently fascinated by Annabel,
and constantly quoted her with admiration. Annabel had
a dislike for plain things and plain people. By this, she
was careful to explain, she did not mean necessarily things
that were ugly or people who were poor. &ldquo;<i>Some</i> ugly
things are really very beautiful, and some poor people are
far from plain. The only kind of plainness that I object
to is commonness; I hate ordinary things.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>Yet if any one had taken the trouble to note down the
things that Annabel called &ldquo;common,&rdquo; it would have been
found that in her eyes these were the inexpensive things,
and the girls whom she described as ordinary were usually
those who were not rich either in money or influential
connections.</p>
<p>Julia saw that Ruth&rsquo;s intimacy with Annabel had made
a change in her, not altogether to be commended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you liked Lois Forsaith as well as you like
Annabel. I do wish that she had a little more fun. She
takes life so seriously. Really, I can&rsquo;t understand it. I
should die, or at least I should want to, if I had as much
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has only four courses this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I do not mean her studies entirely, but at home.
She has a certain amount of housework to do. She helps
her two younger brothers with their lessons, and she always
has some regular sewing on hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really!&rdquo; exclaimed Ruth in some surprise. Julia had
never said much to her about Lois&rsquo; family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say that Lois would have had the highest record
in the class last year if she hadn&rsquo;t stayed out to nurse her
little sister. It was just before the finals, and she had to
lose one of her examinations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t she make it up?&rdquo; asked Ruth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she will have a chance, but of course it makes a
difference in her year&rsquo;s record.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never feel quite sure of Lois,&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;She always
has that far-away manner, as if she were looking
right over your head. I am never sure that she remembers
me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I have not noticed that,&rdquo; responded Julia. &ldquo;I
think her delightful. She shakes hands so warmly, and
she always says something worth hearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think that she&rsquo;s a really popular girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not to her discredit. Popularity is no evidence
of&mdash;of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Julia hesitated, seemingly at a loss for a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True greatness,&rdquo; interposed Ruth. &ldquo;No, popularity is
not a test of true greatness. But I would not say that
Lois is unpopular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Lois could, she would take a larger part in our
social life,&rdquo; added Julia. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very hard for a girl to live
at home while she&rsquo;s going to college. It&rsquo;s like serving
two masters, and one of them has to suffer. Lois will get
the most possible out of her studies, but she can&rsquo;t be
interested in every little thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a regular champion,&rdquo; and Ruth threw a kiss
to Julia, as she turned to leave the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<h2 id="c18">XVIII
<br /><span class="small">WORK AND PLAY</span></h2>
<p>The added strain of rehearsals was more, perhaps, than
some of the performers ought to have had. But few of
them neglected lectures, and they buoyed themselves with
the hope that all this work would be over before the
middle of May, when they could devote themselves wholly
to study.</p>
<p>Julia, perhaps, felt the strain more than the others.
To do the operetta justice she gave up many things that
she would have enjoyed. Rehearsals came so often on
Fridays that she was rather glad that this year she had
not attempted to attend the Symphony rehearsals in the
City. She had taken four tickets for the Cambridge
course, and Ruth and Mrs. Colton regularly accompanied
her. The use of the fourth ticket she offered from time
to time to various girls who had not subscribed for the
course.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>She had had to draw the line at social gaieties, although
she made occasional exceptions, as, for instance, in the
case of the coming-out parties of Brenda and Nora. She
entered into both of these affairs with the zest of a d&eacute;butante,
and was greeted cordially by a number of those of
whom she had seen so much during her first year in
Boston. But she noticed that some of Brenda&rsquo;s special
friends either avoided her or treated her with a deference
that made her uncomfortable, since her years did not seem
to warrant it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because you know so much,&rdquo; Brenda had explained.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re afraid of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they needn&rsquo;t be. I&rsquo;m sure that I never display
my knowledge, and besides, I haven&rsquo;t much to display.
They&rsquo;d find it out if they&rsquo;d talk with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Julia! You do know a tremendous amount. I
feel all shrivelled up when I think of it. Besides, every
one has heard about the operetta. I feel proud enough, I
can tell you, when any one speaks to me about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You used to object to a learned cousin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t now, as long as she doesn&rsquo;t make her learning
a reproach to me. That&rsquo;s one thing very nice about you,
Julia, you never scold me for not going to college.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may come to it yet. Besides, you are studying
this winter, are you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Julia, don&rsquo;t ask me how many times I&rsquo;ve gone
to my Literature class. There&rsquo;s so often a luncheon or
something more interesting that comes the same day, and
when there isn&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m too tired to enjoy it. So I&rsquo;ve
missed more or less, but there&rsquo;s a Current Events on
Mondays and I&rsquo;m always there. It gives me something
to talk about, and I&rsquo;m thankful enough, with a stupid
partner, to fall back on Armenian atrocities, or the
Abolition of the House of Lords, or even the Silver
Question.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;A little learning is a dangerous thing,&rdquo; quoted Julia,
and Brenda replied brightly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But less is more dangerous, and Nora says&mdash;there,
that reminds me, have you heard of the engagement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Nora&rsquo;s?&rdquo; queried Julia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed. Nora says that she&rsquo;s going to Radcliffe
next year, and she isn&rsquo;t likely to let herself be interfered
with by anything so frivolous as an engagement. But
I should think that you might have guessed. It&rsquo;s
Frances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had suspicions,&rdquo; responded Julia, &ldquo;from a letter
Frances wrote me some time ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s always been so chummy with you since
that time she thinks you saved her life. But I was surprised,
and isn&rsquo;t it funny that he&rsquo;s a minister, at least
he&rsquo;s going to be? This is his last year in the Divinity
School. Just imagine Frances a minister&rsquo;s wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have been harder to imagine a year or two
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Frances has changed since that accident, and
then, of course, he&rsquo;s her second cousin&mdash;or third&mdash;and
she can do lots of good with her money,&rdquo; Brenda concluded
somewhat incoherently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>Although Julia did not go to many parties, she yet had
more or less enjoyment from certain phases of Boston life.
Her aunt&rsquo;s house was still &ldquo;home,&rdquo; and thither she went
every Saturday. Many Radcliffe students, like their
fellow-students at the University, were surprised to find
that Saturday was not a holiday, and that only by a skilful
arrangement of courses could one have the day free.
But on Saturday afternoon, all who could went home or
paid visits. At her aunt&rsquo;s behest Julia often took with
her one guest or another to the Beacon Street house, and
often after dinner a little party went to a reading, or a
lecture by some great authority, or to a musicale. Julia
always regretted that Pamela could so seldom be one of
her Saturday guests. But Pamela, who, in this her second
year at Miss Batson&rsquo;s, was less sensitive than formerly
about her position, was apt to say laughingly that Sunday
was her busy day, since all the young ladies were then at
home.</p>
<p>She might have added that she never liked to miss the
Sunday morning service in the little Memorial Chapel beyond
the Washington Elm. There, as in other churches,
seats were reserved for Radcliffe students. The music
and the liturgy, so unlike the simple Congregational service
to which she had been accustomed, rested and helped
her, and she atoned for departing from the rigid forms of
her father&rsquo;s church by holding a little Bible Class at Miss
Batson&rsquo;s on Sunday afternoon. There in the dining-room
she collected three or four small girls from the quarry
district some distance away, and gave them a helping
hand, and taught them many things that they could hardly
have learned from books. No wonder that she could not
accept Julia&rsquo;s invitations! If she had had no other reasons
she would have plead that she was not in touch with
the young circle that gathered in Mrs. Barlow&rsquo;s hospitable
house. Occasionally she went there to dine on
Saturday. This was usually after she had paid a visit
to the Art Museum, where her beloved Tanagra figures
and the Parthenon friezes still charmed her. She had had
some scruples this year in electing Fine Arts, for she knew
that it was considered one of the soft courses chosen by
certain students more anxious to get marks than to learn.
But if many other students had taken Fine Arts in
Pamela&rsquo;s spirit, it would soon have ceased to be a reproach.
For she verified every statement in her text-book,
and looked up every reference made by her professor, and
some of her friends laughingly plead with her not to set
the standard so high, as henceforth every student taking
the course would be expected to do equally well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>Pamela was not in the operetta, for the artistic side of
her nature had not been developed in the direction of
music. Yet from time to time she looked in at rehearsals.
She was proud of Julia&rsquo;s work, for she felt as if no success
could be too great for one who had been so kind to her.
She was fond of Polly, too, and she had enough good
sense not to be offended even when the laugh was directed
against the class of girls of which she herself was a type.
For though she was only one of many who were at Radcliffe
for study exclusively, she felt that she could bear a
little ridicule, since the butterflies themselves were sure
to come in for a share.</p>
<p>She was interested, too, in Clarissa&rsquo;s part in the operetta;
and although she knew that many otherwise charitable
girls had held Clarissa in suspicion since the publication of
the newspaper article, she, too, like Polly, had more faith
in the Western girl. She even thought of doing a little
detective work herself, in a quiet way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>One mild morning in early May a group of girls stood
at the foot of the side entrance to Fay House. &ldquo;Get your
hats! get your hats!&rdquo; cried Polly, approaching the group
from the house. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going home for the largest hat I
own, and I intend to tie it on with a veil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clarissa and one or two of the other hatless girls began
to ask Polly her meaning. But Polly, declining to
answer, walked off with a paper, apparently a letter, held
dramatically to her heart.</p>
<p>Clarissa followed her to the shade of a tree at the edge
of the tennis ground, and there Polly read the note to her:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">My dear Miss Porson</span>,&mdash;May I see you Friday or Saturday
between nine and eleven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the signature was that of the Dean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Polly reminiscently, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s true that I&rsquo;ve
been walking hatless to the Square,&mdash;like several others
I could mention,&rdquo; and she glanced significantly toward
Clarissa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you ought to know,&rdquo; said Elspeth Gray, who had
joined them, &ldquo;that that isn&rsquo;t the thing in a conventional
place like Cambridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but going without a hat seems to be in the direction
of the plain living and high thinking toward which
we&rsquo;re always encouraged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what did the Dean say to you, Polly? I cannot
imagine her being unduly severe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>&ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t severe. She couldn&rsquo;t be. I left her
feeling not that I had been reproved, but simply advised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was nothing said about sitting on the stairs? I saw
you on the landing yesterday, and some of our instructors
complain bitterly of this. They say that it is too much
like the behavior of schoolgirls, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as they express their feelings merely in
words,&rdquo; responded Clarissa, &ldquo;I can bear it. I wish that
they would bestow our marks upon us in words. A
postal card is so much harder to bear when it is stamped
officially, &lsquo;French Department. Your mark in French 11
is C.&rsquo; The big, blue &lsquo;C&rsquo; that they make of such an enormous
size, sprawled across the card.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never mind,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, who had joined the
others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor would we,&rdquo; responded Clarissa politely, &ldquo;if our
marks, like yours, were most likely &lsquo;A.&rsquo; You see the
postmen, like the policemen and the car conductors in this
cultured community, set a value on real intellect, and I
hate to have them know that I am not at the very head of
my class. I don&rsquo;t wish to sail under false pretences, but
I should be happier if my instructors would only spare me
the big, blue &lsquo;C.&rsquo; It always makes me feel giddy, as the
English say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Clarissa, you&rsquo;d pun if you were dying.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can afford to be cheerful, for I&rsquo;ve had an invitation,&rdquo;
and she read from a card that she drew from a
note-book, &ldquo;Le Cercle Fran&ccedil;ais de l&rsquo;Universit&eacute; Harvard
requests the pleasure of your presence on Tuesday evening,
May 17.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are in luck. I hear that it is to be a delightful
affair; but now before we go home for our hats, let us
stroll over to Vaughan House, and patronize Mrs. Hogan
and her buns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A luncheon-room had been fitted up in Vaughan House,
a dwelling recently bought by the Radcliffe Corporation.
It was only a step from Fay House, across the little campus,
and both inside and out it preserved the aspect of a
comfortable dwelling. The lunch-room, to be sure, had
small wood tables of true restaurant style and a counter;
and the coffee and chocolate were drawn from metal
reservoirs, with spigots, in true restaurant fashion.</p>
<p>The three friends, for Elizabeth had not come with
them, sat at a table beside an old graduate, who was
spending the year in Cambridge for post-graduate work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it doesn&rsquo;t seem long,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;since we used
to carry our own sandwiches to Fay House in a little
pasteboard box, and feel extremely thankful for the cup
of hot tea or chocolate brought by the housekeeper to the
little room back of the conversation room. If she went off
before we could pay her, we would hide our dimes or half-dimes
in the sugar bowl, and she always trusted us as we
trusted her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you remember the very beginning of Radcliffe?&rdquo;
asked Polly, &ldquo;when it was called &lsquo;The Annex&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t here myself, then,&rdquo; said the other, smiling;
&ldquo;that was in 1879, but my sister came a year or two later,
when the classes met either at the houses of the professors
or in the little house in Appian Way. The library, I
believe, comprised two or three shelves of books in another
house, and a course with half a dozen students was considered
extremely large.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just think of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My own experience goes back to 1886 when we moved
into Fay House. But it was so different then. I sometimes
wonder if you students of to-day realize your
advantages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather think that we have more fun,&rdquo; said Polly.
&ldquo;I am afraid that you used to take life too seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older girl smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had to be very much in earnest because we felt
that if we made our college work secondary to social interests
we were likely to be criticised. The college girl was
not so numerous then as she is now, and she was a target
for almost any one who wished to criticise her. But I
don&rsquo;t blame you undergraduates for getting all the fun
you can, and your music and your athletics in many ways
must be very beneficial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She means you, Clarissa. She has heard what an ornament
you are to the R. A. A.,&rdquo; cried Polly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; you mean Polly, do you not?&rdquo; asked Clarissa
of the graduate. &ldquo;You have heard of her prowess as an
actor, and then you know she&rsquo;s written nearly all the
book for the operetta. The rest of us have just put in a
few jokes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have had my eye on you both,&rdquo; responded the older
girl, &ldquo;and I approve of you, for you have not yet begun
to make study secondary to fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor was the graduate wrong in her criticism. While
work may have been to a certain extent neglected by the
actors and singers in the operetta in the weeks immediately
preceding the performance, they all knew that when
the rehearsals were over they would work with redoubled
energy.</p>
<p>The advance sale of tickets was so good that Ruth went
about with a beaming face. She was interested in the
North End reading-room to a rather unusual extent, and
had set her heart on their clearing five hundred dollars
from the two performances.</p>
<p>A week before the last rehearsal Julia had asked Angelina
to spend all her time in Cambridge. There were so
many little things that she could do in helping the girls
about their costuming that it seemed as well to have her
near for a week or two. Angelina could be spared, and
Julia knew that the week or two in Cambridge would be
almost as thoroughly a treat to her as a trip to New York
to many another girl. Angelina had become more reconciled
to her life at Shiloh, although she still continued to
say frankly that she would prefer the city. Yet she had
so enjoyed being of acknowledged use to her mother, and
Julia had so praised her for her growing skill in housekeeping,
that she was almost reconciled to her quiet life.
All &ldquo;The Four&rdquo; had continued their interest in the Rosas.
Brenda and Nora had provided their Christmas tree, with
assistance, of course, from Julia. Julia had planned a
little collection of books arranged in two or three small
travelling libraries for the use of the Rosas and their
neighbors, and when a check of good size came from
Edith, to be applied to the use of the family, there was
hardly any evident need to supply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>Edith and her parents were in Europe. They had felt
keenly the fact that Philip had left college under a cloud,
and it was even rumored that they might stay away another
year. Julia, naturally enough, thought often of
Philip, for that last interview with him had been rather
thrilling, and while many of her friends were planning for
the coming Class Day, she had made up her mind to leave
Cambridge as soon as she could after the examinations.
&ldquo;If I live through the operetta,&rdquo; she said to herself, for
she felt the strain of the last rehearsals. When she
thought of Philip, putting even the most charitable construction
on his silence, it seemed as if he might have
written to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>Indeed it was only by a chance word dropped by Nora
and other girls that she heard anything about him. They
had their information from their brothers or some of their
friends. Julia herself might have heard more directly
had she been willing to bring up Philip&rsquo;s name to Tom
Hearst or some of his friends. But she would not ask
questions, feeling as she did that Philip might have kept
her informed of his whereabouts. Yet she knew that he
had spent the most of the winter on a ranch in South
Dakota, not so very far from the Black Hills; and when
reports of the extreme cold in that region came to Eastern
readers, who wondered how Philip enjoyed this rather hard
life&mdash;Philip who had been used to all the luxuries provided
for a rich man&rsquo;s son at Harvard. But Philip did
not write, and Julia would not ask even Ruth about him,
although Ruth and Will Hardon were great friends.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<h2 id="c19">XIX
<br /><span class="small">THE OPERETTA</span></h2>
<p>It was the last rehearsal but one, not the dress rehearsal,
but the &ldquo;half-dressed rehearsal,&rdquo; as Clarissa called it.
At the dress rehearsal a large number of undergraduates,
and special friends of the performers were to be admitted,
and then was to come the performance from which so
much was hoped. But the dress rehearsal would be so
much like a real performance that the present occasion
was regarded as something very important.</p>
<p>Nearly all the chorus were wearing the short peasant
skirt, and strutted about seeming on the whole well pleased
with their own appearance. But the prima donnas were
in ordinary attire, for their bespangled robes were too
elaborate to be dragged about on the dusty stage. Polly
and Ruth in bicycle skirts were rushing among the players,
now giving directions to this one, then to that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must stand better, and do come nearer to the
front; and when Miss Harmon is singing, look toward
her. You are supposed to be hanging on every word of
hers (which we&rsquo;re not usually in reality).&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>The last words, of course, were <i>sotto voce</i>, and the
chorus for the time being made a great effort to obey the
energetic Ruth. Occasionally some girl, forgetting how
much depended on her, would draw her neighbor aside
for a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te, to the great annoyance of the energetic
managers.</p>
<p>Julia, in her chair in the centre of the floor below the
stage, held the score, and from time to time contributed
her word of criticism. But she was glad enough to have
Clarissa and Annabel and Polly and Ruth bear the most
responsibility, as it troubled her to have to pay too much
attention to details. Clarissa and Annabel were lovers in
the play, and to Polly this seemed rather ridiculous, feeling
as she did that she had special insight into the dislike
of Annabel for Clarissa. Clarissa, however, seemed unaware
that Annabel was less than friendly; and although
the latter was not always as perfectly amiable as the Princess
in a light opera ought to be, the rehearsals had, on
the whole, passed off pretty well. Polly herself, as it
happened, was almost the centre of interest in the play.
This had come about by accident rather than by actual
intention on the part of Julia. She was a disguised
Queen, disguised as a youth of humble birth, who had
escaped from court for a frolic, whose grace and wit
carried everything before her. Although she was apparently
Clarissa&rsquo;s rival for a while, everything was explained
when at the very end her disguise was revealed. The
operetta abounded in pleasing duets, bright dialogues, and
witty hits and gibes. But the jokes and hits were never
bitter nor purely personal. They were directed against
the peculiarities of certain groups of students rather than
against the students themselves. Cambridge, too, came
in for its share of ridicule, although the jokes on this
subject were rather threadbare, as they had all been used
in other years by Harvard or Radcliffe undergraduates, in
their dramatic performances or college publications.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>On the whole, it was a composite production rather
than the work of any one individual. Even in the matter
of the music, Julia had accepted more than one suggestion
made by her friends, and in one or two instances she had
composed the words of the lyric, while Polly had composed
the music. In the work of composing and arranging the
operetta there had been really no friction, and all had been
eager to make the affair a success. On this day, when the
final performances were so near, there was hardly a girl
who did not rejoice that they had come to the end of their
weeks of work. Ruth was particularly gratified as they
turned away from the hall. She gave a hop, skip, and a
jump, undignified, perhaps, for a Sophomore, though expressive
of her feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hundreds of dollars!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;My dreams have
been filled with them since yesterday, and we have sold
nearly all our tickets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there will be expenses, dear child. You mustn&rsquo;t
forget that,&rdquo; said Polly, who was one of the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course, but there will be enough left. I&rsquo;m
glad, too, that the whole performance will be so creditable,
and we ought to be thankful enough that no one has been
ill, or for any other reason obliged to give up her part.
Anything like that would drive me to distraction, for we
have no understudies.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Julia, &ldquo;every one has given every one else
so much advice that I am sure that any one who has
watched the rehearsals could take the part of some other
girl at a moment&rsquo;s notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure,&rdquo; responded Ruth, accepting her friend
more seriously than the latter intended. &ldquo;One or two of
the parts might, perhaps, be taken, but not Polly&rsquo;s. She
puts a new touch in at almost every rehearsal, and honestly,
I think that she has made the thing the success that
it is. Excuse me, Julia, I didn&rsquo;t mean that we owe more
to the performers than to the composer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, indeed,&rdquo; replied Julia, &ldquo;I understand exactly
what you mean, and it is fortunate that Polly&rsquo;s father was
not as ill as she feared a week or two ago, for if she had
had to go South it would have made a great difference
to us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>Nor were the girls wrong in their expectations. The
dress rehearsal went off with all the sparkle and life
that they had hoped. The regular performance they felt
to be a more trying occasion than the rehearsal, for the
audience included so many persons from Boston, as well
as from Cambridge, whose judgment carried great weight.
But critical or not, they were thoroughly appreciative of
the pretty operetta. More than once were the singers and
actors called before the curtain; and had Julia not been
too modest, she, too, would have answered the calls that
were made for her. Some of those who were not ardent
admirers of Annabel were pleased that she did not&mdash;apparently
could not&mdash;eclipse Polly and Clarissa. Sweet
though her voice was, it was not powerful, and her self-consciousness
often spoiled the effect of her acting.
Brenda, of course, was at the play, and a large party of
her gay young friends from the City. In the party were
Tom and Will and a number of college men, and Julia,
sitting among them, felt that she was almost as merry in
spirit as they. Yet more than the praises of these young
people, Julia appreciated those of her uncle and aunt who
sat in the tier of seats just behind; for her aunt was
apparently satisfied by the commendation she received for
the operetta that her devotion to her work was not going
to separate her entirely from young people of her own age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this operetta, my dear, is on the whole so frivolous
that I have some hope that college is not going to
deprive you entirely of your interest in society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the close of the performance, as the actors stood
behind the scenes listening to the commendations of their
friends, a telegraph messenger pushed his way among them
with a dispatch for Polly.</p>
<p>Polly&rsquo;s color faded as she heard him ask for her, and
she turned to Julia with an appealing &ldquo;Read it&rdquo; as she
laid the slip of yellow paper in her hand.</p>
<p>Quickly grasping its contents, Julia threw her arms
around her friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, my carriage is ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the carriage did not appear for more than five minutes,
during which Polly&rsquo;s sobs were painful to hear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s her father,&rdquo; explained Clarissa to a group of
girls who had withdrawn some distance from the weeping
Polly. &ldquo;He died this morning, according to the
telegram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This morning!&rdquo; cried one of the girls. &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s a
wonder that she wasn&rsquo;t notified earlier. Why, it takes no
time for a telegram to travel from Atlanta to Boston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A telegram!&rdquo; cried Ruth, who had just come behind
the scenes; &ldquo;why, that reminds me. But what&rsquo;s the
matter with Polly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, she&rsquo;s just had news of her father&rsquo;s death, and
she must feel dreadfully to think that she has been acting
this evening, for he died, they say, this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Elspeth was speaking Ruth had turned very pale.
She put her hand in her little velvet chatelaine and drew out
a yellow envelope, apparently another telegram. Without
a word to the others she walked up to Polly and Julia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a telegram that came early in the evening,
before we began; you ought to have had it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Polly did not wait for further explanation; she tore
open the envelope. Then after reading the telegram, she
thrust it inside her dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot forgive you,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;How could you
let me sing? My father died to-day, and what will they
think of me when they hear that I sang just the same! I
will not forgive you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stern words were followed by violent sobs.</p>
<p>This outburst was so unlike the lively, amiable Polly
that her friends were only too glad when Julia&rsquo;s carriage
was announced; and leaning on Clarissa&rsquo;s arm, she was
led away, closely followed by Julia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>The girls who were left behind speculated as to what
Polly would do; whether she would start for home immediately;
whether her feeling would continue to be bitter
toward Ruth for withholding the telegram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet it doesn&rsquo;t seem altogether like Ruth,&rdquo; said
Elspeth. &ldquo;Fond as I am of Polly, I feel that there may
be some mistake. I am sure that Ruth could not have
known about the telegram; could not possibly have held
it from Polly if she knew what was in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But unluckily among those whose thoughts were favorable
to Ruth, Julia was not to be counted. Her disapproval
of Ruth&rsquo;s intimacy with Annabel now seemed to
have been well founded. She felt sure that unintentionally
Ruth had adopted Annabel&rsquo;s rather easy standards of duty
to others. &ldquo;The greatest good of the greatest number,&rdquo;
Annabel was apt to offer as an excuse for some action
which other girls called selfish. For when criticised she
would try to prove that while one or perhaps two girls
were injured by something that she had said or done, an
indefinite number of indefinite people would approve,
and therefore might be benefited by it. Annabel had a
smattering of philosophy, as she had of other subjects,
obtained before studying them; and had she learned more
of the philosopher whom she quoted almost unconsciously,
she would have known that above all other rules he set
the Golden Rule. To do unto others as she would have
others do to her was certainly not a guiding star of Annabel&rsquo;s
conduct.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>Thus, after all, there had been an element of tragedy in
the operetta that had once meant only sunshine to those
who were working and planning for it. Polly Porson,
speeding Southward, would have felt doubly forlorn had
not Clarissa been with her. For the Western girl had
insisted on going with her friend, and though her absence
from Cambridge at this time meant some loss in the coming
examinations, she would not have listened had any one
attempted to dissuade her from going. She did her part,
too, in softening Polly&rsquo;s feeling toward Ruth, and she was
surprised to find how earnestly she could champion the
cause of a girl who had so often seemed anything but
friendly toward her. But while she knew that Ruth had
taken no pains to conceal a certain dislike for her, she
realized that it was a case of mere personal antipathy,
unaccountable, perhaps, as such things often are, or to be
accounted for by the fact that in every way the two girls
had received a very different training.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m sure that Ruth wouldn&rsquo;t do a mean thing,
and to have kept that telegram from you would have been
mean beyond description.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly, absorbed in her sorrow, and thinking more about
the meeting with her mother and little sisters, had little
to say, although firmly fixed in her mind was the thought
that Ruth really had served her own ends by holding the
telegram from her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>Clarissa was soon back at Cambridge, and by good luck
lost not a single examination through her absence. She
would not even admit that her sudden trip, by interfering
with her study, had lowered her standing. When the blue-books
were all in she was able to announce triumphantly
that her average was higher than ever before. &ldquo;Which
proves,&rdquo; she had said to Elspeth, &ldquo;that cramming is a
luxury and not a necessity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia did not stay in Cambridge this spring for either
the Radcliffe or the Harvard Class Days. She went with
her aunt and Brenda to New Haven for the ball game,
where Arthur Weston was their host; and although he
was as polite as he could be, Julia knew that all his interest
was really in Brenda. Arthur, whose brother had
married Brenda&rsquo;s sister, was fond of calling Brenda sister-in-law,
and for the same reason he had adopted Julia as a
cousin. By a strange coincidence, he, like Philip, had
failed to take his degree the preceding June. This was
due to ill-health, which had kept him from college part of
the year. But unlike Philip, he had been willing to take
his place with the next class, and indeed seemed as well
pleased as if graduating with his own class. Brenda&rsquo;s
disposition, too, was as volatile as Arthur&rsquo;s, and she
carried a blue parasol, wore blue flowers, and altogether
seemed to have forgotten the existence of Harvard and
her former love for Harvard red. It was hard for
Julia to understand such heartlessness as this,&mdash;for
so she had to regard it,&mdash;as until very lately all Brenda&rsquo;s
college feeling had been for Harvard. Yet Brenda herself
would not admit that it was really a strong personal
preference for Arthur that had made her forego her
Harvard allegiance. She fell back on the excuse of relationship,
and on the fact that she had caused the accident
which had finally resulted in Arthur&rsquo;s losing a year at
college.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>&ldquo;For although he knows that it was an accident, still it
certainly was my bicycle that hurt his foot, and I ought to
make up by showing all the interest I can in his college.
Between us,&rdquo; she added confidentially, &ldquo;I think that Harvard
Class Day is really more fun; still, I&rsquo;m having about
the best time of my life here at New Haven, although I
do not quite see why it should be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Julia understood, and Mrs. Barlow understood,
and they smiled indulgently when they saw the two young
people strolling off under the New Haven elms.</p>
<p>When the gaiety of the late spring was over, Julia was
glad to be back again at Rockley. She needed rest, and
she had the good sense to spend her summer quietly. In
the early autumn, with her aunt and uncle, she made a
tour of the mountains, and the keen air put her in even
better trim for her autumn&rsquo;s work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<h2 id="c20">XX
<br /><span class="small">JUNIORS</span></h2>
<p>To follow all the happenings in the college course would
take more time than may well be given now. The beginning
of the Junior year found Julia and her friends all so
accustomed to college life that they could hardly imagine
themselves existing without a well-planned scheme of
work. As Juniors, they were more constantly deferred to
by the girls in the two lower classes, and they could not
but realize that they were near the Senior class, and that
at the end of another year they would be almost at the
end of their college course. Many new girls wandered
about the halls of Fay House, and among them Julia was
delighted to have Nora included, for Ruth and Julia had
not fully made up their misunderstanding of the spring.
If they had spent the summer together, things might have
been different. But they had been separated for a longer
time than ever before since their friendship began; and
while neither reproached the other, both realized the
coolness between them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>Nora was only a Special student, and she always referred
to her studies in rather humble tones. But she worked
zealously, and confided to Julia that she might possibly
enter the regular course, and end by studying medicine,
if her parents would only consent. But Julia, though she
did not doubt Nora&rsquo;s sincerity, still realized that there
were many things that might prevent her carrying out
these rather impossible plans.</p>
<p>Polly, in sombre black and somewhat quieter in manner,
was still Polly, and she and Clarissa were constantly
together. With Julia and Lois she was always cordial,
and she still continued to tease Pamela whenever the
occasion presented. But at sight of Ruth her flow of
words always ceased. It was plain that she found it very
hard to forgive.</p>
<p>This year Annabel and Ruth were a little less intimate
than formerly. Yet this did not bring Julia and Ruth
any nearer. They still roomed together, still went back
and forth to Fay House together. Those who knew them
best did not realize that anything had come between them.
But they themselves, while realizing the change, would
not touch on the subject that lay so near their hearts.
The spot on the apple, the rift in the lute, of these and
many other similes Julia often thought, but she would
not take the first step to mend the breach. She waited for
Ruth&rsquo;s explanation, and Ruth waited for Julia&rsquo;s apology,
and each day the two moved farther away from each other.</p>
<p>As to Polly, in some way she and Ruth contrived never
to meet face to face, a feat not impossible, since they
happened to have none of the same courses, and since
Polly&rsquo;s mourning for her father kept her from taking an
active part in the social life of the college.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>There were various changes in the grouping of those
girls who had been most together in their first two
years.</p>
<p>Pamela alone, among those whom we have known the
best, went on her way undisturbed. She had not been
present at the little outbreak at the close of the operetta.
In a general way she knew that there had been trouble,
but she had asked no questions about it. In any case, she
would have been sure that Julia was entirely right. Her
summer, spent as before in tutoring, had helped greatly to
free her from care. The scholarship, again awarded to
her, the two Boston boys whom she was to tutor twice a
week in Greek, had made her third year at Radcliffe a
certainty. She continued to live at Miss Batson&rsquo;s; and
although her duties were lighter and she had a room to
herself, the good boarding-house keeper declined the
weekly payment that Pamela conscientiously offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had a room twice as big as that little attic, and
on the first floor front, it would just be a comfort to have
you here, without your paying a cent. All my young
ladies say they have just been getting culture ever since
you came here, and that&rsquo;s worth more than money to all
of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Pamela felt herself to be almost rich, as she gathered
her treasures about her in the little French-roofed chamber.
Chief among them was a Tanagra figurine, a replica of the
lady with the hat that Julia had insisted on her accepting
the year before. On the shelf below were her Dante
books, and near them some of her father&rsquo;s Greek books,
as well as those that she used in her own classes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>Under the great professor, who in this country stands for
the study of Dante, she was reaching heights even more
blissful than those reached through her study of Greek.</p>
<p>As to Clarissa, she and Polly each had a grievance, and
each was bound to help the other right a wrong&mdash;or perhaps
I should say, each meant to help right the other&rsquo;s
wrong. Polly kept her eye on Annabel, and Clarissa&mdash;well,
Clarissa had a theory that in time she hoped to prove
true.</p>
<p>There were many girls, unluckily, who looked on Clarissa
with decided disfavor, believing her the author of the
objectionable article; or at the best, they thought that she
had unwisely let others use her note-book improperly. Two
or three little coteries, therefore, some of them made up of
very agreeable girls, were inclined to avoid Clarissa. So
Polly, realizing this state of affairs, was all the more
anxious to prove that her friend had been wronged. But
how prove it?</p>
<p>One morning half a dozen girls clustered before the
bulletin board. The assortment of notices touched every
side of college life. One in which Polly Porson had had
a large part read:</p>
<p class="center">Freshmen and New Specials
<br />are
<br />Cordially invited by the Juniors to a reception, Wednesday, October 31, in the Auditorium, at 4.30 <span class="small">P.M.</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>Polly&rsquo;s part had consisted of the dainty pen-and-ink
drawing showing at the top a vivacious girl with arms
extended, while at the side was a troop of smaller girls,
presumably the Freshmen and Specials, with accompanying
verses:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;School is over, oh, what fun!</p>
<p class="t0">Lessons finished, work begun.</p>
<p class="t0">Who&rsquo;ll laugh gayest? Let us try.</p>
<p class="t0">Who&rsquo;ll talk loudest, you or I?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Near by was a card giving information about the College
Settlement Association, and others announcing a trial of
voices for the Glee and Choral Clubs. But most conspicuous
of all were the notices of the various athletic clubs,
and these notices seemed to awaken a lively discussion
among the girls standing before the board.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;R. A. A.&mdash;Will all who wish to join please pay,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>read one of them, adding, &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve joined and paid, too.
I&rsquo;m more interested in the basket ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the managers mean business,&rdquo; added another,
pointing to a notice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="center">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Basket Ball</span>, 189&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great need of candidates. All that can, come out and
try for the teams, whether they played last year or not.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t for me,&rdquo; said one of the girls, who happened
to be a Sophomore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have a strong team this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; continued a classmate, &ldquo;the Juniors can&rsquo;t
do a thing to us unless Miss Hert&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; exclaimed the first speaker, and turning her
head slightly, the second girl saw Clarissa and Pamela
approaching, arm in arm.</p>
<p>But as the two friends disappeared in the distance, a
third girl, a Junior, said, &ldquo;Yes, Clarissa&rsquo;s the girl we want
but Alma Stacey is determined&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that she&rsquo;s been pretty severe toward Clarissa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Annabel says&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Annabel&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Annabel says that she believes that Clarissa would
do almost anything after playing that trick on her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, about Mr. Radcliffe, the so-called Mr. Radcliffe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly at this moment had passed them a second time,
although now without Clarissa.</p>
<p>Quickly guessing the subject of their conversation, she
interposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, breathes there a Radcliffe girl so silly as to think
that Clarissa had anything to do with that book-plate
affair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon the others, Juniors and Sophomores, admitted
that they had not wholly believed Clarissa responsible for
Annabel&rsquo;s discomfiture, although one of them added that
there seemed little doubt that Clarissa had sanctioned the
newspaper article. Yet, if Polly could not make an adequate
reply to this (for not yet had she completed her detective
work), she assured them that Clarissa was so popular that
she had been urged to join the basket ball team, and that
through her the class was to reach a pinnacle of fame in
athletics.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>Indeed, during this year it seemed as if athletic rather
than scholastic glory was the thing most sought for. The
new Gymnasium had given an impetus to all kinds of
athletics, and with the increasing size of the classes, the
long-delayed class spirit was beginning to develop.</p>
<p>Julia was a spectator at the Athletic Reception given by
the Freshmen, and she laughed and applauded all the
sports from the potato races to some of those trials of
skill that required great proficiency. She had sprained
her ankle very slightly soon after college opened, and this
prevented her usual gymnasium work.</p>
<p>It was natural that there should be many little coteries
at Radcliffe, and that some should be more devoted than
others to study, and others more devoted to the lighter
side of college life. Julia, now that she and Ruth were
less inseparable, found herself turning more and more to
Lois, and for Lois she began to feel even more sympathy
than for Pamela. Although Pamela had had to struggle,
she still had been able on the whole to carry out her plans.
Lois, on the other hand, had constantly been obliged to
contend with an unsympathetic family. Her mother
thought that on leaving the High School she ought to
have been contented with a year in a training school.
This would at once have fitted her for public school
teaching. Money certainly was needed in the family, and
Lois was not selfish. Yet when a relative, appreciative of
her talent and ambition, offered her the money for the
four years&rsquo; tuition at Radcliffe, she felt it to be not only a
privilege, but a duty to accept. Lois in accepting, however,
in the midst of her college work had constantly the
feeling that she ought to consider her family more. It
was indeed a difficult task to which she had set herself,
to be both the dutiful daughter at home and the college
student keeping her studies of first importance. It was
the old story of trying to serve two masters; she was
unable completely to please her family, and she lost much
of the joy of college life because she could give so little
time to the pleasant idling in which a girl must indulge if
she wishes to be popular.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>Even to herself, Lois perhaps never said that she wished
to be popular. Yet she had an inborn spirit of leadership;
and if she had listened to the urgings of her friends, she
would have allowed herself to be a candidate for the Idler
Presidency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly useless,&rdquo; she remonstrated. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
the time, I haven&rsquo;t the least chance of success. Besides,
a great many other girls are much better fitted for the
office. Honestly, I don&rsquo;t think that I have a single
qualification.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but you&rsquo;d make such an ornamental President,&rdquo;
said Polly teasingly, knowing that this was the least
sensible argument to use, for Lois not only seemed
quite unconscious of her own attractiveness, but disliked
these frivolous remarks. Yet although Polly spoke thus
teasingly, she was in earnest in what she said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t enough energy myself to electioneer,&rdquo; she
had said to Julia, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m going to make myself as agreeable
as I can to everybody; and if you will help, and if
Clarissa will help, and in fact if every one will help, why,
Lois shall be the Idler President.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally, if every one helps,&rdquo; and Julia smiled; &ldquo;but
of course you can count on me, for I should be only too
glad to see Lois loaded with honors. I consider her the
very ablest girl in the class. What a credit she&rsquo;ll be to
us on the Commencement platform, with second-year
honors, and a <i>summa cum</i>, and probably with a prize or
two thrown in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly, if the truth were known, was perhaps more
anxious to have Lois regarded as a probable candidate
because she had heard that Annabel was also turning her
thoughts in the direction of this office. Therefore, early
and late, and without making her efforts too evident, she
tried to create a sentiment in favor of Lois, so that when
the election should come, it would seem the most natural
thing in the world for her to be chosen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>On the whole, in this its Junior year the class was more
united than ever before. At the Junior luncheon, more
than one of those who responded to the toasts called attention
to this fact. Annabel was still Class President,
and indeed most of the class officers remained the same.
But I am not sure that Polly would have admitted that
this was a real sign of class unity. Annabel was still a
conspicuous figure at the Idler theatricals, and she had
even written a little play herself. Some of her admirers
said that it contained passages that were wittier than anything
in the operetta. But the authors of the operetta,
composer and librettist, were not disturbed when this was
repeated to them. Julia was not ambitious to shine again
as a composer, at least for the present. Her very success
had made her realize her own limitations, and she decided
to make no further effort in this direction until she had
perfected herself in the underlying principles. Nor did
Polly intend to appear before the world as a full-fledged
author. So the praise of Annabel, as sung by her special
admirers, did not disturb her.</p>
<p>A few of the girls who were especially fond of society
went out more than during the first two years. Some
attended the Cambridge Assemblies, and an energetic
group arranged a series of Junior dances, which, sanctioned
by those in authority, proved altogether delightful. Julia
attended the Assemblies largely because Brenda urged her
to, and Brenda and a crowd of young people from town
came out to them.</p>
<p>Clarissa went to the Junior dances, but she was not
sufficiently in society to be asked to the Assemblies.
Clarissa, however, had a faculty of enjoying herself at all
times, and she did not show that she felt certain slights
offered her, notably that of keeping her off the team.</p>
<p>In the natural course of events, she should have been
chosen captain, but the influence of Alma Stacey was
strong, and Clarissa was not even on the team.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>But college festivities were not the only pleasures offered
the girls. Not a few of the class who lived at home in
Boston or Cambridge or the suburbs entertained at their
own houses. An occasional tea, an evening of private
theatricals, all these things relieved delightfully the monotony
of study. Yet to a popular girl they offered great
temptations for wasting time, and in college life, as in the
outside world, it was hard to draw the line between necessary
and unnecessary amusements. But when a wave of
whist swept through the class, some of the more sedate
began to protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but it strengthens the mind, it really does,&rdquo;
pleaded Polly, when Julia remonstrated; &ldquo;and you know
I&rsquo;m not dancing&mdash;or anything,&rdquo; glancing down at her
black gown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but afternoon whist parties, and two or three of
them a week! Why, you will soon have no mind for
anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not so sure of that, though it&rsquo;s time to
begin to study a little, as the mid-years are coming. But
you look so sad over it, Julia, that I may swear off, like
our old friend Rip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope that it will be a different kind of swearing off
from Rip&rsquo;s. Otherwise&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it shall be otherwise for the rest of the year, so
far as whist is concerned, so worry no longer, fair creature,&rdquo;
and Polly went away laughing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<h2 id="c21">XXI
<br /><span class="small">A FORTUNATE ACCIDENT</span></h2>
<p>One morning in January Lois entered Fay House with
what Clarissa would have called a &ldquo;long-drawn face,&rdquo; and
with traces of tears in her eyes. She had a letter in her
hand, crumpled shapelessly.</p>
<p>The postman had given it to her as she was leaving her
house in Newton, and she had been carrying it without
realizing that she had it. Now, as she drew off her
gloves, she saw the letter, and as she smoothed it out,
again her eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p>To a certain extent the letter seemed like a death warrant,
for it contained news that the relative who had been
paying Lois&rsquo; tuition could do so no longer, and that not
even the payment for the second half-year would be forthcoming.
This to Lois meant that with the mid-years
her Radcliffe work must end. Moreover, recent family
troubles made it almost necessary that it should end.
The required sum was not so very large, but for Lois it
was absolutely unattainable. It was too late in the year
for a scholarship award, and indeed the idea of holding a
scholarship was distasteful to her. There was no one from
whom she could borrow, no one to whom she was willing
to confide her private affairs. She knew that there were
schools in some of the smaller towns where she would be
accepted as a teacher even without the college degree, and
immediately she decided she would go to an agency to
learn where there might be a vacancy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>Among all her classmates Julia was the only one to
whom she would have been at all willing to confide her
trouble, and yet Julia was the very one to whom she could
not go, because Julia was the one who might have helped
her. To have told Julia of her difficulty would have
seemed to her too much like asking a favor&mdash;an impossible
thing to one of her proud spirit.</p>
<p>Lois carried her burden without speaking of it for several
days. She meant to say nothing until the mid-years
were over. She intended to keep up her courage to the
end. She studied all the harder, for she meant these mid-year
examinations to be the best that she had ever had.
She meant to reach the highest possible mark. For although
she intended to return to college when she had saved
enough money, she knew that happy day might yet be
some distance away. One day soon after she had received
the letter that had so disturbed her, Lois remained rather
late at Fay House. She had been at work in the library,
for the next day the examinations would begin, and it
happened that the most important was to come on that
first morning. At home that evening she would finish
the review of a certain very important book. She felt
that she had not yet given it sufficient attention, and she
realized that much depended on her understanding two or
three difficult chapters. Passing through the hall where
groups of merry girls were coming out from some Freshman
celebration in the Auditorium, Lois, with a head
throbbing from hard study, decided to walk for a mile or
two before taking the car. As she walked along trying
to solve a problem that touched on her examination, forgetting
for the time the more personal cares that had
weighed her down lately, she turned into a side street
that took her a little out of her course. In the spring and
early autumn she was fond of this street, because of two
or three old-fashioned gardens upon whose quaint flowers
she loved to gaze. The street was lonely and the houses
far apart, and Lois began to walk more rapidly. In the
faint light, for it was now almost dark, Lois paused for a
moment to look over the fence of one of the old gardens.
Near a tall tree in the corner in summer there was a bed
of lilies of the valley that she had often stopped to admire.
Now as she leaned absent-mindedly on the fence for a minute,
she thought that she heard a groan as of some one in
pain. Hastily pushing open the gate she heard the sounds
growing louder as she approached the house. There were
no lights in the windows, but stepping bravely up on the
little piazza she entered the half-open door. She stumbled
as she entered, and reaching down she touched a warm,
breathing face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>&ldquo;Help me!&rdquo; cried a faint voice, and then another deep
groan. A faint light came from a back room, and Lois,
quick-witted, hurried in there, and in a second returned
with matches. When she had lit the gas-jet in the hall,
she saw that the sufferer was an elderly woman whom she
had often noticed in the garden, and had seen occasionally
at Radcliffe functions. Lois was tall and strong, and the
sufferer was slight, so without delay she lifted her to a
couch in the sitting-room.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic4">
<img src="images/pic4.jpg" alt="&ldquo;Lois made the bandage and put it on with a professional air&rdquo;" width="500" height="789" />
<p class="center">&ldquo;Lois made the bandage and put it on with a professional air&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my foot,&rdquo; moaned the sufferer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go for a doctor at once,&rdquo; said Lois, &ldquo;but first I
must put on a cold compress. It&rsquo;s evidently a bad sprain.
There seem to be no bones broken,&rdquo; she concluded, finishing
her examination.</p>
<p>Stripping up a cover from a pillow in an easy-chair, and
finding her way to the running water in the kitchen, Lois
made the bandage and put it on with a professional air.</p>
<p>Few words had passed between them, but as she left the
room, &ldquo;Dr. Brown,&rdquo; said the sick woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; responded Lois, &ldquo;I was going for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not far to the physician&rsquo;s house, and when he
had examined the foot he pronounced it, as Lois had,
merely a bad sprain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My maid won&rsquo;t be back until eleven o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said the
sick woman. &ldquo;I let her go to Woburn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can get a nurse,&rdquo; responded the doctor. &ldquo;You
mustn&rsquo;t be left alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have a nurse about me. You&rsquo;ve often heard
me say that,&rdquo; cried Miss Ambrose petulantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t be left alone,&rdquo; rejoined the doctor
firmly.</p>
<p>Miss Ambrose looked at Lois appealingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let me stay with you!&rdquo; exclaimed Lois impulsively,
forgetting her examinations, forgetting the important review,
forgetting everything but the fact that before her lay
a suffering human being whom she might help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would I be of use?&rdquo; she asked, when the doctor did
not immediately reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of use!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I should say so; a girl
who knows just what to do with a sprained ankle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was arranged that a telegram at Miss Ambrose&rsquo;s
expense should be sent to Lois&rsquo; family, saying that she
would stay all night, and the physician&rsquo;s name, Lois knew,
would assure her mother that it was a case of necessity.
&ldquo;Illness of a friend,&rdquo; he had put in the telegram, leaving
it to Lois to make explanations when she reached home.</p>
<p>After the doctor left, the sick woman lay silent with
her eyes closed&mdash;whether half asleep or not Lois could
not tell. She had refused Lois&rsquo; offer of assistance in putting
her to bed, saying that she would be more comfortable
on the lounge until her maid should come.</p>
<p>As Lois watched her lying there, her regular features
outlined against the pillow, her pale face looking even
paler, surrounded with a mass of sandy, gray-streaked
hair, the strangeness of the situation occurred to her, as it
had not at first. Then she began to realize that she ought
not to play Good Samaritan at this time, for it came back
to her with overpowering force that this was the eve of an
examination, that she really depended on these last few
hours of review. Well! there was no reason why she
should not study here, though the light was rather dim.</p>
<p>As she turned toward the door to bring her books from
a table in the hall, Miss Ambrose started.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, indeed.&rdquo; Lois had quickly returned with the
book under her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a student,&rdquo; said the invalid, now wide awake.
&ldquo;I have often seen you pass with your books under your
arm. Where is your school?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Radcliffe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how I envy you!&rdquo; and Miss Ambrose sighed.
&ldquo;When I was your age I would have given all&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A twinge of pain prevented her finishing the sentence.
Lois laid down the book, and, lifting the coverlid, moved
the foot to an easier position.</p>
<p>Again Miss Ambrose closed her eyes, and Lois, turning
down the light, sat and watched her a little longer. It
was now half-past seven and Lois felt faint. She had had
nothing to eat since breakfast, except a light luncheon.
Passing to the kitchen for the water for the compress, she
had seen dishes piled on the table, and she judged that
Miss Ambrose had had an early tea. Then Miss Ambrose
opened her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you would like to study now; the light will
not disturb me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; responded Lois. &ldquo;I really need all the
time I can have. I have an examination in psychology
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then pray go on without considering me. It is a
great relief to me to know that you are here. But I feel
so drowsy that if I fall asleep I am sure that you will
excuse me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>In a short time Miss Ambrose seemed to be really
asleep, and Lois bent over her books with great zeal.</p>
<p>The examination in psychology was one that would
require a cool head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Explain the utility of cerebral hemispheres.&rdquo; Lois
turned from the test question to her note-book. She
was able to answer it satisfactorily. &ldquo;In the lectures
mental life was several times described as a &lsquo;collection of
interests.&rsquo; Explain the phrase, and give the chief reasons
for holding it to be a true description of at least a great
part of mental life.&rdquo; This, too, Lois found no difficulty
in answering. But occasionally she came to a question
that needed something more than either memory or her
lecture notes. She exerted herself to the utmost. But
alas! the more she studied, the more she realized that she
had the greatest need of her text-book, and this she had
left at home. It was too large a book to carry back and
forward to Fay House, for she had felt that she would do
best to spend the last hours in a careful study of its pages.</p>
<p>It was nine o&rsquo;clock when Lois made this discovery, and
Miss Ambrose had not awaked. Lois blamed herself for
not giving her college work first place in her mind when
she made her offer to stay with Miss Ambrose. But Lois,
in her way, was a philosopher, and since she could not
have what she needed the most, she resolved to do the
best possible with what she had. She devoted herself,
therefore, to her note-book, and tested her knowledge of
the subject with various specimen examination papers of
past years. It was brain-consuming work, and Lois was
so absorbed in it that she did not hear the maid when she
opened the front door with her key.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sakes alive!&rdquo; exclaimed the maid, amazed at this late
hour to see a stranger seated at the centre table, while her
mistress reclined on the lounge. Her loud tone woke
Miss Ambrose, who at once began to explain the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I started upstairs, after going to the front door for my
paper, and when I reached the top I remembered that I
had left the door half open. Some way I slipped as I
turned around, and fell the whole way. If it hadn&rsquo;t been
for this young lady I might have been there yet with my
foot twisted under me,&rdquo; and Miss Ambrose raised her hand
to her eyes, greatly disturbed by the thought of what
might have been. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to stay all night,&rdquo; she
added, after a moment&rsquo;s pause. &ldquo;See that the spare
room&rsquo;s ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m, but I wonder if the young lady mightn&rsquo;t like
something to eat before going to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me,&rdquo; said Miss Ambrose, almost attempting to
rise from her couch. &ldquo;I dare say the child hasn&rsquo;t had
any tea. I&rsquo;d had mine before she came, but I never
thought to ask her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think not,&rdquo; responded Lois, &ldquo;with your lame
foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But pressed for an answer, she admitted that she had
eaten little since breakfast, and when Dr. Brown returned
at eleven, he found Lois at a side table with a cup of
chocolate and a plate of bread and sliced cold beef before
her. With his help Miss Ambrose was carried to her
room upstairs, and he assured her that with patience and
the care that Maggie would give her, he knew that she
would soon be herself again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>&ldquo;How soon?&rdquo; asked Miss Ambrose anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he replied cautiously, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a matter of weeks
rather than months, but I can hardly undertake to say
precisely how long it will take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Lois went to the room prepared for her the doctor
gave her a word of commendation for her kindness to Miss
Ambrose. &ldquo;Your bandage had a professional touch,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she responded, &ldquo;you know I wish to
study medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve heard,&rdquo; replied Dr. Brown, who had a slight
acquaintance with Lois&rsquo; family, &ldquo;although you understand,
I suppose, that it&rsquo;s a long and hard road, especially
for a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she said, less cheerfully, perhaps, than her
wont. Indeed, as she sat in Miss Ambrose&rsquo;s quaintly
furnished spare room, the professional course for which
she hoped seemed farther away than ever. With one last
glance at her notes before she went to bed, she heard the
clock strike twelve before she fell asleep. In the morning
she woke early, and was again at her work, with a sigh for
the text-book which she could not see until she reached
Fay House, where there was a copy in the library. It
was hardly seven when Maggie knocked on the door, to
say that breakfast would be ready at eight, and that Miss
Ambrose would be glad to see her at any time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have been very kind indeed to stay with me, and
you must promise to come to see me as soon as you can.
I shall certainly be here for the next two or three weeks.&rdquo;
Miss Ambrose smiled faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s too bad.&rdquo; The voice of Lois had the ring of
true sympathy. &ldquo;The next two or three weeks will be
pretty busy for me, as all the mid-years come then, you
know. But I shall drop in, in passing, for I shall be very
anxious to see how you are getting along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, it will please me so. There is so much
that I wish to ask about the college. When I was young
there were no colleges for girls, and my parents would not
have let me go away from home. But I had a brother
fitting for college, and by myself I studied just the same
things that he did. How I envied him his chances! Ah!
he didn&rsquo;t half appreciate them.&rdquo; Then Miss Ambrose
paused, as if weighed down by sad memories. &ldquo;Well,
afterwards my mother tried to get permission for me to
study at Harvard, or even to have examinations on subjects
that I had studied at home. But it was useless.
Nothing could be done about it, although we had relatives
in the Faculty and many influential friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they approve of your wishing to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not altogether. In fact, some of them thought
me bold to talk about it. But&mdash;well, I&rsquo;m glad that the
girls of this generation have the chance that I longed for.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>Later Lois learned from those who knew Miss Ambrose
that she was really a very accomplished woman, and that
she had studied many subjects under eminent professors.
The brother, who had had the chance for which she had
vainly longed, had not turned out well, and had had to
leave college without his degree. Ill-health in later years
had somewhat interfered with Miss Ambrose&rsquo;s studying,
and she had a wistful expression, such as one often notes
on the faces of those who have missed their highest
ambition.</p>
<p>Lois, walking down to Fay House in the fresh morning
air, thought of the contrariness of Fate. Here was Miss
Ambrose, who so evidently might have afforded the luxury
of a Harvard course, had this been a possibility in her
youth, and here was she, Lois, longing for it, yet likely to
be debarred from completing her work from the mere need
of a little money. But brushing these thoughts aside, as
unworthy a sensible girl, Lois returned to her psychology,
and mentally worked out a problem or two before she
reached Fay House.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<h2 id="c22">XXII
<br /><span class="small">ANNABEL AND CLARISSA</span></h2>
<p>The skating this winter of Julia&rsquo;s Junior year was
unusually good, and during late January and early February
crowds went each afternoon to Fresh Pond. Julia,
Ruth, Polly, and Clarissa were particularly zealous, and
they were all fine skaters. Annabel excelled them all,
and none were unwilling to admit her superiority. During
her residence abroad she had spent a winter at Copenhagen,
and she could accomplish all kinds of wonderful feats
learned there in a most graceful way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she were as genuine in other things as in this, we
wouldn&rsquo;t criticise her so, would we, Julia?&rdquo; and Polly
linked her arm in Julia&rsquo;s for another turn round the pond.</p>
<p>Annabel, indeed, distanced some of the Harvard youths
who hung about her. It pleased her to show that she did
not need their assistance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>Skating was Annabel&rsquo;s one outdoor accomplishment, for
she was not generally fond of athletics. One afternoon a
dozen or more Seniors were up at Fresh Pond. Clarissa
skated almost as well as Annabel, but Polly and Julia
were less expert, although they were both better skaters
than Ruth. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go over by the ice-houses,&rdquo; cried
Polly, skimming past Julia and Clarissa. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a thin
place there and they are just going to rope it off. I was
asked to warn everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we know it is thin, thank you,&rdquo; responded Julia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Polly, &ldquo;only a goose would skate over
there; any one can see it&rsquo;s thin, the ice is so dark. Only a
goose would skate near it&mdash;or a person who was absorbed
in showing off,&rdquo; and she pointed toward the dangerous
spot, which Annabel was approaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you warn her?&rdquo; asked Clarissa, turning to
Polly. &ldquo;You passed her on the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I didn&rsquo;t. I was thinking only of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Annabel knows so much, she would have known
the ice wasn&rsquo;t thin, even if you had told her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>But even while they spoke, Clarissa had started off at
full speed, and as the others turned to watch her they saw
Annabel on the very edge of the dark ice. Polly knew
that this was the dangerous place, and called out loudly to
Julia to follow her. These things take almost as long in
the telling as in the happening, and before Julia and Polly
could reach the other two, Annabel had gone through the
ice just as Clarissa had almost overtaken her. Without
a moment&rsquo;s hesitation Clarissa threw herself into the
chasm, and for a moment it looked as if she would only make
a bad matter worse. But Clarissa knew that they were
near the shore, and that with even a few strokes she could
get herself into shallow water. She had thrown off her coat
as she ran, and her arms were unencumbered. Moreover,
she had felt justified in making the bold plunge, because she
had seen several young men approaching from the crowd
of skaters at the opposite end of the pond. Dragging
Annabel somewhat roughly then, she struggled on toward
the bank, and to her great joy she soon found her feet
touching the bottom. Ready hands were stretched out to
her from the shore, where already a crowd had assembled,
and indeed two youths had plunged into the water to help
her support Annabel. The latter was altogether overcome
by the shock. Although she had not exactly fainted, she
was so benumbed as to be helpless. But for Clarissa&rsquo;s
quick action she might have suffered much more. Hardly
were they out of the water when a student returned with
a sleigh, whose driver he had stopped in passing. The two
drenched girls were bundled under the robes, and taken to
a house not far away. Julia and Polly drove quickly down
to Cambridge for fresh clothes, and before sunset Annabel
and Clarissa were back in their own rooms. Annabel,
however, really suffered from her mishap. She had struck
her head on the ice in falling, and in consequence a slight
fever set in which at first seemed rather serious. Her
friends kept her room filled with flowers, and all her classmates
showed great sympathy when it was rumored that
she might have to drop out of the class for the rest of the
year. Clarissa had never fully realized Annabel&rsquo;s unfriendliness,
and so when the latter sent for her she was only too
glad to go to see her. She thought that Annabel&rsquo;s thanks
were warmer than they need have been, for Clarissa assured
her that she had really been in little danger, and
that even without her help, she would not have been long
in the water. Annabel in her r&ocirc;le of invalid, reclining in
an easy-chair, with her room filled with flowers, was indeed
picturesque.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some day,&rdquo; she said faintly, &ldquo;when I feel a little
stronger I must have a long talk with you. I feel that I
have done you an injustice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; replied Clarissa, &ldquo;I am sure that you have
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; sighed Annabel, &ldquo;I will tell you sometime.
It is hard now to explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I rather think that I can wait, if you can. You
make me think of Pamela, whose conscience is always too
active to be healthy,&rdquo; rejoined Clarissa, with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Annabel dramatically, &ldquo;you will believe
me when I tell you all, but not now. Yet believe
that I shall feel forever indebted to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; responded Clarissa, &ldquo;if it makes you happier
to put it that way. But really&mdash;&rdquo; Here they were interrupted
by the arrival of other callers, and Clarissa soon
took her departure. She had only a vague idea of Annabel&rsquo;s
meaning, although she thought that she undoubtedly
had some reference to the publication of Professor Z&rsquo;s
lecture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>She did not permit herself to dwell long on a subject
that concerned herself so entirely. Recitations were to
begin again in a few days, and she was very anxious to
have a meeting of the class called to consider the question of
the Presidency of the Idler. It was the custom to appoint
to this office the girl who had been Vice-President in the
Junior year. It happened, however, that Regina Andrews,
the girl now in office, had announced her intention of spending
the next year in Europe instead of in the regular work
of the Senior year. Polly and Clarissa, therefore, had at
once begun to work up a strong sentiment in favor of Lois.</p>
<p>Lois, had she known of their well-meant efforts, would
probably have stopped them by explaining that she herself
had lost not merely the prospect of being a Senior, but even
of finishing the work of her Junior year.</p>
<p>She had agreed to take the position in the Village High
School, twenty miles away, and she was to go there
February 15th. Until the opening of the recitation period
at the close of the mid-years, she intended to say nothing
about her changed plans.</p>
<p>Yet Clarissa and Polly could not help seeing that she
took little interest when they told her of Regina Andrews&rsquo;
resignation from the Vice-Presidency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re bound you shall have it, Lois. We think that
you are the very best girl for the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Julia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;d all like Julia, but she says that nothing
would induce her to take it. She hates presiding, and she
has made us promise not even to let her name come up.
She is particularly anxious to have you,&rdquo; and Polly&rsquo;s tone
would have been convincing to any one but a girl who
had put a task upon herself in which class honors had no
part. There had been times, of course, when popularity
and the thought of being Idler President would have given
her a great joy. But now&mdash;ah! in a day or two Polly
and Clarissa would know just how matters stood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>On Saturday Julia invited her to luncheon, and afterwards
they were going to town to a concert. Ruth had
gone home over Sunday, as had been her habit this year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly delighted, Lois, that you are to be the
next Idler President, for Polly says that there isn&rsquo;t a
shadow of a doubt. She has been so determined that the
office should not go to Annabel that she has turned into a
regular wire-puller. Even Annabel&rsquo;s illness has made
little difference to her, although I think that Clarissa has
a more friendly feeling toward her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed Lois, &ldquo;I must talk seriously with
Polly and Clarissa. I have told them that I could not
stand, but they won&rsquo;t believe me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why, Lois, why should you not take the office if
it comes to you? You preside so well, and you are not
timid, as I am, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, Julia&rdquo;&mdash;Lois knew now that it was best to
explain the whole matter&mdash;&ldquo;because I may not be here
next year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then in as few words as possible, Lois told Julia that
loss of money and other things made it expedient for her
to take a year or more away from college.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot bear to be counted out of this class, but there
is no help for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julia very wisely did not attempt to dissuade Lois from
her purpose of teaching, although already a little plan had
begun to form in her mind. Yet she was sympathetic,
and told Lois that it was simply impossible to think of the
class as ready to graduate without her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;ll all have to stay out a year, just to keep
up with you,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>But in her own room that evening, Julia pondered long
over the perversity of Fate, that hampered girls like Jane
and Pamela and Lois, who loved study for its own sake,
while many others were able to glide through college with
no thought of the great privileges that were open to them.
&ldquo;The worst of it is, the girls whom one would like to help
are always the proudest.&rdquo; Then Julia put her mind on
the subject, and decided that if she could help it Lois
should not leave college.</p>
<p>As Lois had finished her examinations in the first two
weeks, she found time for more than one brief call on
Miss Ambrose. It was so easy to drop in for a half-hour
in passing, and the interest of the older woman in all her
affairs was so genuine, that it was a delight to tell all that
she could about college life. One day she stayed to
luncheon, and enjoyed the service of quaint, old-fashioned
china and silver, and she stole glances of admiration as
she ate, at the massive mahogany sideboard and the
spindle-legged serving table and the delicate steel engravings
on the wall. Then in Miss Ambrose&rsquo;s sitting-room
she found so much to gratify her love of antiquities.
There was the cabinet, for example, with its wedgewood
vases, and the mosaics collected in Europe, and the little
book-shelf with its tiny volumes of the Italian poets,
bound in vellum, and the half-dozen miniatures on the
mantle-piece of Miss Ambrose&rsquo;s parents and other relatives,&mdash;all
these and many other things claimed Lois&rsquo; attention,
although most interesting of all was Miss Ambrose herself.
A well-cultivated mind has always a strong charm for a
thoughtful girl, and Miss Ambrose had certainly more
culture than belongs to the average college graduate, man
or woman. She had travelled and she had studied, yet
she always seemed ready to hear Lois&rsquo; views on any subject
of general interest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>&ldquo;You look pale,&rdquo; said Miss Ambrose abruptly on this
particular day; &ldquo;you look pale, and if you will pardon
my saying it, a trifle worried. A young person should
never show the touch of care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I ought not to look worried,&rdquo; said Lois soberly.
&ldquo;I am sorry to appear so&mdash;so stupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could never appear stupid,&rdquo; rejoined Miss Ambrose,
&ldquo;but you are certainly paler. I hope that you are
not working too hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, work always agrees with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then something is troubling you,&rdquo; persisted Miss
Ambrose firmly. &ldquo;I fear that you were less successful
than you would have been had you not taken care of me
the night when I sprained my foot. I know that you
were to have an examination the next day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; and Lois smiled like her usual self. &ldquo;Oh,
no, I came out better than I expected in that. I had
an &lsquo;A.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I am really puzzled,&rdquo; said Miss Ambrose, adding,
with a slight touch of severity, &ldquo;I should think that you
might trust me sufficiently to tell me what the trouble
really is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>Now even a fortnight earlier, Lois would hardly have
believed any one who had told her that after a brief acquaintance
she could have found it possible to open her
heart to one whom she had known so short a time. Yet
although she confided comparatively little, Miss Ambrose,
reading between the lines, saw that the young girl was
making a great sacrifice in stopping her course at this
stage. &ldquo;Sacrifice&rdquo; is not perhaps exactly the right term,
for on the part of Lois it was involuntary. Until she
could earn money, it was not possible for her to continue
her course. Yet when Lois had told Miss Ambrose all
her reasons for leaving, the older woman merely expressed
the conventional words of regret. Her eyes held rather
more than their usual look of absent-mindedness.</p>
<p>Great, therefore, was the surprise of Lois, on reaching
home on that Saturday evening after she had been with
Julia, to find a letter awaiting her from Miss Ambrose.
From between the pages a thin blue slip fluttered to the
floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must accept this,&rdquo; wrote Miss Ambrose in her
fine, pointed handwriting, &ldquo;as a very slight tribute of my
indebtedness to you. I do not refer merely to the sacrifice
you made in staying with me the evening when I was
hurt; but you have done me a great favor in bringing
me in touch with the woman&rsquo;s college. You have given
me an insight into the life of a college girl. I know that
you will continue to keep me informed about it, and thus
I shall enjoy through another a little of what I so longed
for in my youth. From this time I intend to contribute
a certain amount toward the education of one or two
students, and I am sure that you will oblige me by being
the first to give me the privilege of doing something for
the honor of good scholarship.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>Picking up the blue slip, Lois saw that it was a check for
one hundred and fifty dollars. The amount took her
breath away. It meant not only the payment of her tuition
for the next half-year, but it gave her a margin for
other things, something even to save toward the expenses
of the next year, for Lois was a good manager, and her
pulses beat to fever heat as she thought of all that she
could do with this money.</p>
<p>She found that her parents made no objection to her
keeping the check, and she had no hesitation in breaking
her engagement with the Village School, as she knew that
another approved candidate for the position had been
sadly disappointed when it was given to her.</p>
<p>Lois felt that she had done nothing to deserve this good
fortune, and yet she was too sensible to decline what
came in her way. She realized that her own greatest
usefulness in the world would come from finishing her
college course, and she lost no time in thanking Miss
Ambrose, and in assuring her that she would do her
best to deserve her confidence. Then Miss Ambrose
smiled a contented smile. At last she had a direct
interest in the woman&rsquo;s college.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<h2 id="c23">XXIII
<br /><span class="small">CLOUDS CLEARED AWAY</span></h2>
<p>Julia was the first person outside her own family to
whom Lois told her good fortune, and Julia, to tell the
truth, was a trifle disappointed in hearing of it, for she
had formed a little plan of her own, and if Miss Ambrose
had not been ahead of her, she would have come forward
to prevent Lois&rsquo; leaving. She told Clarissa, however,
how near the class had come to losing Lois, and Clarissa,
not vowed to secrecy, told others. The disclosure was
entirely to the advantage of Lois, for all the class expressed
itself fully as to its great loss, if its most promising
student had had to leave for the mere lack of a little
money. Clarissa and Polly artfully took advantage of this
feeling, and talked about Lois&rsquo; accomplishments so persistently
that even the least interested admitted that she
was the very girl for the Idler Presidency. It was hard
for Annabel to count herself altogether out of the running,
but at last she submitted gracefully to what she could not
help; and if she did not try to forward Clarissa&rsquo;s cause,
she certainly did nothing to hinder it. As she improved
in health she did not open her heart to Clarissa, and she
made no admission of knowing more than any one else
about the publication of Professor Z&rsquo;s notes. She was
very friendly to the Kansas girl, and even invited her one
afternoon as guest of honor to one of her famous little
afternoon teas. Polly laughingly accused Clarissa of
permitting herself to be bribed into friendliness. But
Clarissa retorted that she had never felt unkindly toward
Annabel, and that in time wrongs generally righted themselves.
It was probably through Annabel&rsquo;s influence that
Alma Stacey bent all her energies toward getting Clarissa
on the basket ball team, and succeeded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>As the spring passed on, many pleasant little social
events brought the Juniors in closer contact with girls in
the other classes. The students of highest rank had been
elected into the various clubs, according to the studies in
which they excelled. No one with less than two &ldquo;A&rsquo;s,&rdquo; or
two &ldquo;B&rsquo;s&rdquo; with two additional courses could be admitted
into these exclusive little organizations, and membership
in the History or English or Philosophy Club, or indeed
in any of several others, was accounted a great honor.</p>
<p>Julia was in the History and Music Clubs, Polly was in
the English Club, Lois was in half a dozen of them, and
Clarissa, almost to her own surprise, was in the Philosophy
Club, having made a great impression on her classmates,
as well as on her professors, by her very original
method of interpreting various theories of philosophy.
The Juniors were admitted in season to take part in the
open meetings of these clubs, to which were invited the
members of the corresponding clubs at Harvard, as well
as the teachers in the department and individual guests
of honor from outside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>The Juniors, however, felt closer in touch with the
Seniors when they planned one or two special things in
honor of the class so soon to go out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They treated us well when they were Sophomores, and
we were nothing but Freshmen, so now we must do our
best to make them feel that they really will be missed,&rdquo;
said Julia, as she and Polly and one or two others of the
committee were planning what form the Senior party
should take.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s no danger of their not thinking that they
will be missed,&rdquo; cried Polly. &ldquo;Why, I believe that
Elizabeth Darcy anticipates that the decline of Radcliffe
will date from the day of her graduation. But we won&rsquo;t
let a little prejudice stand in the way of our giving them
a good send-off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This particular affair was called a music party, and a
prize was offered by the Juniors to the Senior who should
show herself most familiar with unclassical music. The
prize was a pretty little old Dutch silver violin, and to the
amusement of all it went to a girl who sang all the lyrics
from all the operettas composed by Radcliffe girls during
the past five years. She offered to play each operetta
through from beginning to end, but the judges (which
meant the whole Junior class) begged off and declared
that she had sufficiently shown her ability, and had really
earned the prize. So with much laughter the tiny violin
on a crimson ribbon was slung around her neck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>In return the Seniors gave the Juniors a party, requesting
in their invitations that each girl should bring a book
for the little white bookcase in the Senior room. &ldquo;As
you will soon be Seniors yourselves,&rdquo; the invitations had
said, &ldquo;these books will really be for your own use, and
you have always been so unselfish that you wouldn&rsquo;t have
thought of doing this had we not reminded you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Senior rooms occupied the first floor of a pretty
old-fashioned cottage on the Fay House grounds. With
good rugs, well-chosen pictures, a piano, writing desk,
lounge, and easy-chairs, they offered a pleasant retreat for
the Senior who wished to escape the noise of the larger
buildings. Once a week during the winter the Seniors
were at home for an informal afternoon tea, and it was
only on this set day that an undergraduate ventured within
the precincts. The old-fashioned house had been bought
by the Radcliffe Trustees in their efforts to acquire for a
campus all the land in the immediate vicinity of Fay
House, and the little house in the natural course of events
would sometime be pulled down. But in the meantime
it was a delightful place of retreat for the Seniors. To be
sure, Elspeth Gray, who had been in New York during
the spring recess, brought back glowing accounts of the
Senior room at Vassar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These rooms look countrified compared with the Vassar
room. Why, there, although they always have the same
room, each Senior class refurnishes it. Even the wall
hangings are changed. This year instead of paper they
have put on a painted burlap, stencilled in gold, which
cost nearly two hundred dollars; and the furniture and
bronzes and oil paintings, although many of these things
are simply lent by Seniors for the year, would make your
eyes open, you simple-minded Radcliffeites.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>&ldquo;Plain living and high thinking is the rule at Cambridge,&rdquo;
responded Ruth, who happened to be one of the
group to whom she spoke. &ldquo;Come, Elspeth, don&rsquo;t join
the crowd that is sighing for a porter&rsquo;s lodge, or a boy in
buttons, or some similar luxury here at Radcliffe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear child,&rdquo; and Elspeth drew herself to her full
height, &ldquo;I did not say, did I, that I preferred the elegance
of Vassar and Bryn Mawr, but we haven&rsquo;t even
any palms, such as they have at Wellesley, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we have historic associations. There&rsquo;s the
Washington Elm, almost under our eyes, and we&rsquo;re so
nearly a part of Harvard that we can look back on a long
and honorable past, even if we have less than twenty
years of our own to count up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spring would have been altogether perfect for
Julia but for her estrangement from Ruth. It was hard
to approach Ruth on the subject, because there had been
no open break between them, and because Ruth gave her
no chance to seek or make an explanation. They still had
their rooms together, but Ruth always studied by herself
in her own room. Occasionally on Mondays Ruth appeared,
but she was oftener absent when Julia was entertaining
those girls who dropped in. As Nora was only a
Special, she was in Cambridge little except for recitations.
Yet she had noticed the coolness between the two, who at
Miss Crawdon&rsquo;s school had been great friends. She could
not help observing, too, that Ruth was never at Mrs.
Barlow&rsquo;s on Saturday and Sunday, when Julia and Brenda
were so apt to have their friends about them. Ruth, to
be sure, always pleaded that she must spend as much time
as possible with her mother, who had been abroad in search
of health during Ruth&rsquo;s first two college years. She was
still an invalid; and although Nora knew that Ruth naturally
wished to be with her, this explanation did not wholly
account for the coolness between Ruth and Julia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>From Julia she at last drew an account of the affair of
the telegram, and the injury done to Polly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t altogether what Ruth did, but it&rsquo;s her indifference
that has disturbed me so,&rdquo; said Julia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she didn&rsquo;t do it; perhaps there&rsquo;s some explanation
about the telegram. Really, Julia Bourne, I
did not think that you could be so unreasonable. But
I&rsquo;m not altogether sorry,&rdquo; she continued, smiling, &ldquo;that
you have shown yourself just a little less perfect than we
thought you. I used to think you absolutely reasonable,
but now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you ever had so foolish an opinion of me, I&rsquo;m
glad that something has happened to remove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must tell Brenda,&rdquo; added Nora, as she bade Julia
good-bye. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be pleased to hear that I&rsquo;ve picked a
flaw in her perfect cousin. Secretly, I believe that she
thinks you almost too perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>Not long after Nora had left her, the postman put into
Julia&rsquo;s hands an envelope, on which she recognized Angelina&rsquo;s
handwriting. Angelina had not been in Cambridge
this winter. Indeed, the day after the operetta she had
gone back to Shiloh, and in the autumn she had taken a
place as mother&rsquo;s helper in a household where there were
several children. It was near enough to her own home
to permit her to see her mother and the children twice a
week, and Mrs. Rosa was now so much stronger and the
young Rosas were so much older that they could manage
very well without Angelina. It was better for Angelina
to have the responsibility of a position where she could
earn money. Already she had started a bank-book, and
in every way she was much more contented than a year
before. She was very fond of letter-writing, and her
epistolary style was decidedly high-flown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Miss Julia,&rdquo; the present letter began. &ldquo;I
have a confession to make, though I know that you will
say that I am always sinning and repenting. But this
was not exactly sin, only the kind of carelessness that you
have often reproved me for. You see I saw Miss Ruth
the other day, and I asked if that telegram did Miss Polly
any harm, I mean her not getting it at once. You know
I went home the next day and never heard about it. But
I thought that next morning you didn&rsquo;t look as happy
as you ought to after an enthusiastic reception of your
operetta (that was what the newspapers said), and so
when I asked, Miss Ruth said that it made a great deal of
trouble for her. I wonder how that was when the telegram
was for Miss Polly? I suppose it was something
about her father, for I heard he died. I know that I
ought to have given it to her as soon as it came, for she
was trying a song with you, and they sent it over from
her boarding-house. But Percy Colton asked me to come
down and pull some molasses candy in the kitchen, and I
forgot all about it until after the performance. Then
Miss Ruth, when I told her, said that she would give it
to Miss Polly quick, so I don&rsquo;t see why it made any
trouble for her. I&rsquo;m very sorry, but that&rsquo;s the way
things happen in this world&mdash;just exactly the way they
oughtn&rsquo;t to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>The letter gave more information about Angelina&rsquo;s
personal affairs, but only the above passage made any
impression on Julia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Angelina!&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;you always have had a
fashion of making trouble, but luckily in this case, it&rsquo;s
not too late to straighten things out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To decide, with Julia, was to act. Overhead she could
hear Ruth moving about in her room. Running up the
stairs, two at a time, in a moment she was with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ruth, can you ever forgive me? How mean you
must have thought me! But really, I&rsquo;ve suffered more
than you; even if this letter hadn&rsquo;t come, I should have
told you so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What letter?&rdquo; asked Ruth, thoroughly bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, from Angelina; it was she who kept the telegram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course; I always knew it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <i>I</i> didn&rsquo;t know it. There, I won&rsquo;t throw blame
on any one else. It has all been my fault, and not
Angelina&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All&rsquo;s well that ends well,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Ruth, pinning a
crimson rosette at her belt. There was a slight stiffness
in her manner, but she looked at Julia with her old-time
pleasant smile; and as they clasped hands, the two girls
knew that they were friends again. &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; she
added, &ldquo;it was hard, Julia, to find you unjust&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you had only said the least little word, I should
have understood, Ruth, but when you said nothing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how could I say anything? When you so evidently
had your mind made up, what could I say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but I must tell Polly. Won&rsquo;t you come with
me, Ruth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not this afternoon. I&rsquo;m going to a ball game with
Will; it&rsquo;s only with Amherst to-day. But there&rsquo;s a
party of a dozen going, and not a chaperon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. That&rsquo;s the one delightful thing about
Cambridge; we can go to ball games without any of the
trammels of an &lsquo;artificial etiquette,&rsquo; as Clarissa might
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Ruth departed for the ball game, with Will
holding her parasol, and Julia standing in the doorway,
waving her a good-bye after a fashion that had not been
possible during the past year.</p>
<p>From Ruth, Julia went to Polly, and it was harder to
bring up the subject of the telegram to her, for the very
mention of it recalled so many sad memories.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, after all, Clarissa has been the most charitable of
us all. Seems like we have all been carried away by suspicion,
while she has always been inclined to stand up for
Ruth,&rdquo; said the Southern girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, in other things besides murder trials, it isn&rsquo;t
worth while to trust to circumstantial evidence. But I
am the most to blame, for I ought to have known Ruth
better than to suspect her of a meanness. I shall begin to
wonder now if I haven&rsquo;t been unfair to Annabel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it, for I happen to know that she borrowed
Clarissa&rsquo;s history note-book a few weeks before that article
appeared,&rdquo; rejoined Polly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Julia, &ldquo;until I&rsquo;ve removed the beam from
my own eye, I won&rsquo;t search for the mote in Annabel&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Polly penitently, &ldquo;as you put it, I believe
that there is a beam in my eye also. But I shall lose no
time in apologizing to Ruth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Polly apologized, and spread the news abroad that
she had been very unfair. Julia, too, was repentant, and
that May and June of their Junior year was much
brighter than the same months had been when they
were Sophomores. Then when Lois was elected Idler
President, Polly went about beaming. She declared that
she had not lived in vain, and to celebrate the joyful
event arranged a canoeing party at Riverside. There
were twenty girls in the party, and Mrs. Colton and Professor
and Mrs. Redburn went as protectors. They rowed
and paddled, and listened to the band, and consumed unlimited
quantities of ginger ale and sandwiches. They
wound in and out on the curving river, and the lights of
thousands of lanterns shone upon them from the river
banks and the boat-houses, for it was a special night with
the boat clubs. It was a delightful celebration and well
planned, and although some of the girls were unduly
daring and seemed to court collisions, when they were
counted at the end of the trip they were found all to be
there, to the great relief of the elders of the party. They
had sung college songs until they were almost hoarse, but
Clarissa had voice enough left to propose a vote of thanks
to Polly, adding, &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t a Float Day, nor a Lake
Waban, but the Charles is free to all, and where is there
a stream that is half as fascinating for canoeists?&rdquo; And
all the others answered, &ldquo;Nowhere.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<p>While it was yet uncertain whether or not Clarissa
would go on the team, the Spring Meet came off in the
Gymnasium, in which her name was down for several
events. The Gymnasium was crowded with friends of the
contestants and members of the R. A. A., and many were
there as strong partisans of various girls who were to compete
in the many different contests. In the horse vault
and the saddle jump, some wonderful records were made.
But for some reason the greatest interest centred in the
running high jump, and Clarissa&rsquo;s friends had prophesied
that she was to make the record in this. She had a formidable
rival in Mary Francis, a Senior, and an especial
friend of Elizabeth Darcy&rsquo;s, who had held the record for
two years. The two classes and their friends watched
both girls with the closest attention. Polly and Julia
were perfectly sure of Clarissa, and the latter fairly
hugged her when with flushed cheeks and her dark hair
lying in moist little ringlets on her forehead she was
declared the victor. Not only that, but with fifty-four
inches she had made a record that was to put her and
her class on a pinnacle. This, indeed, marked the beginning
of great successes for that class, and brought
out the fact that a genuine class feeling had been established.
No one in the earlier years of the Annex or
Radcliffe could have imagined that this feeling would
become so strong. Each girl was beginning to be thought
of, not as an individual, but as a member of the class,
likely to reflect upon it scholastic or athletic glory. Clarissa&rsquo;s
success at the meet made it seem all the more likely
that she would be captain of the team. Even had there
been a faction against her, it would have been difficult to
keep her down. But there was no such faction, for the
prejudice of the year before had almost completely died
away. There was hardly a girl to take exception to the
cheer when it rang out:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Radcliffe, Radcliffe, Radcliffe,</p>
<p class="t3">Rah, rah, rah,</p>
<p class="t3">Rah, rah, rah,</p>
<p class="t3">Rah, rah, rah,</p>
<p class="t0">Miss Herter and the team!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&mdash;a cheer that contained a prophecy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<h2 id="c24">XXIV
<br /><span class="small">SENIORS ALL</span></h2>
<p>How quickly that summer before their Senior year
passed away! Probably hardly a girl in the class failed to
regret that they were travelling so quickly toward the end
of their college course. During the summer a dozen or
more had sent a vacation round-robin about from one to
another. Clarissa had written a witty letter describing
her experiences in drinking the waters at Manitou, whither
her father had been sent in search of health. She also mentioned
incidentally that she was practising ball, &ldquo;for our
team is to come out the very top of the heap, but don&rsquo;t
repeat my language,&rdquo; she had concluded. Julia wrote of
a very quiet summer at Rockley, as her aunt&rsquo;s illness had
prevented a proposed European trip. Lois had had three
weeks in the White Mountains with Miss Ambrose, where
Polly had joined her for a fortnight. Instead of tutoring,
Pamela had felt warranted in giving her summer to research
work, but she had done this without suffering in
health, because she had found a delightful little village on
the Maine coast where the board was almost nothing, and
where she had just the inspiration she wanted in hearing
the surf roll in upon the beach. Elspeth Gray wrote of
an encounter that she had had with&mdash;well, it is not necessary
to go into particulars&mdash;but with the graduate of a
well-known college for women, who had pitied her very
much because her lot had been cast at Radcliffe. &ldquo;As if
I hadn&rsquo;t chosen this lot for myself with all the colleges of
the country spread out before me. She said that we had
no college spirit, and that we ought to see that there was
a lack of dignity in accepting a degree that was only a
kind of imitation of a Harvard degree. But it&rsquo;s useless to
argue with such people, although I did make her admit
that Harvard offered more to men than did any other
college in the country, and she was amazed to learn that
we had precisely the same courses of study, the same instructors,
and the same examinations as Harvard men
have. Dear me! where have people been brought up to
know so little?&rdquo; Each girl whose name was appended to
the round-robin, while expressing her anxiety to see her
classmates again, added a note of sorrow that this for the
majority would be the last year at Radcliffe. A few
intended to return for higher degrees, but it was doubtful
if all could carry out their plans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">257</div>
<p>In the meantime they were getting all they could out of
college life. Those girls who came from a distance were
especially anxious to make up for lost time by going to
lectures, concerts, or by visiting art galleries and historic
towns, that they might feel that they had lost none of the
special advantages that Cambridge and Boston offer the
college student. Clarissa, who had done much sight-seeing
in her Freshman year, now thought that her greatest
need was for Sever Hall lectures, and she made up a little
party consisting of Polly and two or three others of her
classmates, who agreed to go with her two evenings a
week. She enjoyed whatever lectures came on those
evenings, for she said that three years at Radcliffe ought
to have fitted her to understand anything. She continued
to attend lectures even when her classmates, on one pretext
or another, had dropped off, for she was so fortunate
as to run across a special student of good standing
who had given up her position in a Western High School
for the sake of a year&rsquo;s study at Cambridge. A little later
Pamela made one of the party, as it had been her habit
the past two years to attend all the lectures or readings
given by the Senior professor of Greek. While some
Radcliffe Seniors were to be found at all of the Sever
Hall lectures, Clarissa in this last year was really the
most persistent, and she was the more persistent, perhaps,
because some of her friends tried to dissuade her from
burning the candle at both ends. They spoke in this way
because Clarissa was steadily adding to her reputation as
an athlete. She was now captain of the team&mdash;a position
that many of the undergraduates regarded as more enviable
than that of President of the Idler. It was a great
grief to Polly that she could not play basket ball, but
when she presented herself for the necessary physical examination,
a slight weakness of the heart and lungs was
discovered, in itself not serious, although sufficient to
render her an unfit candidate. In consequence to assuage
her disappointment she made herself an amateur coach and
spent what time she could watching the practice games.
Her observation was keen, and more than one suggestion
of hers was put into practical effect.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<p>She was sure not only that the Senior team would vanquish
all the others at Radcliffe, but that in its outside
contests it would carry all before it. &ldquo;Oh, if we could
only have a chance against Bryn Mawr!&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;Of
course that day is coming, but if it would only come in
our day! Was there ever such a captain?&rdquo; she concluded,
with an admiring glance at Clarissa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, I am sure,&rdquo; replied Pamela. &ldquo;I love to look
at her. She is the very picture of health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There couldn&rsquo;t be a better centre, not only because
she&rsquo;s so tall, but because she has such judgment. How
she managed it I don&rsquo;t know, but she contrived to get
Julia for one of her forwards and Ruth for the other.
Neither intended to play this year. But there they are!
They both have cool heads, and there&rsquo;s little danger of
their losing their wits in an exciting match.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pamela glanced for a moment toward Julia, who stood
ready to make a goal, with the ball held lightly in her
finger tips. Even while they were looking, with a little
twist she threw it, and it fell into the basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I count it one of my privileges in coming here,&rdquo; said
Pamela in her prim little way, &ldquo;to have known Julia
Bourne. Whatever she does, she does so well, and she
always has a thought for others. She is always so encouraging.&rdquo;
Just at this moment Julia glanced toward her
friends, and though she did not really bow to them, she
smiled pleasantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one lesson we can learn from basket ball,&rdquo;
remarked Pamela.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Pamela,&rdquo; and Polly laughed. &ldquo;Sermons in
stones, books in the running brooks are nothing to your
lessons. But there, don&rsquo;t blush at me, but tell me what
you had in mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I was only thinking that it&rsquo;s less what the individual
player does than what the team does as a whole.
A girl who thinks only of her own ability to make a
wonderful throw may make a throw that will gain great
applause, but she generally sends the ball into the hands
of the enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like Elizabeth Darcy last year. Did you see that
match?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; responded Pamela.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she brought down the house with two or three
brilliant throws, but she really did more to hurt her team
than any one on the other side. If I had been Clarissa I
should have been afraid to have Annabel on the team for
the same reason. She thinks of herself first, and of the
general good last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Human nature according to Hobbes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear, I never think of ethics out of the class-room.
There&mdash;there look!&rdquo; and both girls turned to see
a goal scored for Clarissa&rsquo;s team&mdash;or rather for their own
team, since Clarissa was the embodiment of the Senior
athletic aspirations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<p>The match with Wellesley was one of the things of
which they were sure, and it was likely to be exciting.
Brenda teased Julia when she heard of the coming contest
by saying that she was bound to be on the side of Wellesley
this year, for Amy had just entered Wellesley, and
Brenda was still very fond of her. Since their trip to
Nova Scotia they had seen little of each other except in
summer, for Amy had been very hard at work preparing
for college, and society had absorbed Brenda the past two
years. Amy had felt especially tender toward Brenda the
past year or two, because the beginning of their acquaintance
had seemed to mark the beginning of prosperity for
Amy and her mother. The efforts of Mrs. Barlow and
Mr. Elton had resulted in a fairly large sale of Mrs. Redmond&rsquo;s
paintings. Indeed, her water-color sketches had
become so much the fashion that her income now permitted
her to live in Salem. Thus Amy for a year or two had
been able to see much more than in former years of her
schoolmates out of school, and some of her little sharp
corners had been entirely rounded off. The death of
Cousin Joan the past winter had made it possible for
Amy to enter college without any worry as to ways and
means; for although the money left by Cousin Joan from
most points of view would have been considered very
small indeed, it was enough to carry Amy comfortably
through college. It was left to her for this purpose, &ldquo;in
recognition,&rdquo; as Cousin Joan wrote in a note that was
found with the will, &ldquo;of her patience with a very troublesome
old woman.&rdquo; Amy, wiping away a few tears, as
she thought of the invalid whose life had been so narrow,
protested that it was her mother and not she who should
have the money as a reward for patience. But Mrs.
Redmond reminded her daughter that the money was
really a gift to her as well as to Amy, since she would
now be saved a certain amount of financial care in planning
Amy&rsquo;s college career. Therefore, Amy at Wellesley, and
Julia at Radcliffe, at odds only on the subject of some college
championship, exchanged visits and compared notes,
and each ended invariably by thinking her own college the
best.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>Brenda and Amy had been a little less intimate since
those first Rockley days, and in the past year the former
had been away in California; at least, she had gone for a
year&rsquo;s absence in the March of Julia&rsquo;s Junior year. She
wrote to Amy as to Julia rapturous letters about the
beauties of California, mingled with entertaining accounts
of her sister Caroline&rsquo;s children. Before Christmas Mr.
and Mrs. Barlow started for California to visit their daughter
and bring Brenda home. Nora went with them, by
special invitation, as an attack of measles in the early
autumn had prevented her resuming her special work at
Radcliffe, and her eyes needed the rest.</p>
<p>In the absence of her relatives, therefore, Julia was
naturally thrown more in the society of her Radcliffe
friends than had been the case in other years. Edith was
spending the year abroad, and the little group of Miss
Crawdon&rsquo;s girls was widely scattered. Julia spent Christmas
with Ruth in Roxbury, where Pamela, Clarissa, and
Polly were also invited; for Ruth, although she had not
entirely changed in her general opinion of Pamela and
Clarissa, had still changed somewhat in her feeling toward
them. She had learned to see the good points of the
candid Western girl and of the timid Vermonter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>In justice to Ruth, it should be said that her change of
view was not entirely due to the fact that the class, as a
whole, had now a much greater appreciation of these two
than in their first college years. She had seen her own
mistake in attaching too much importance to Annabel&rsquo;s
judgments. This, combined with her own slight prejudice
against girls a little unlike those to whom she was accustomed,
had made the trouble. Ruth, too, had suffered so
much from Julia&rsquo;s coldness after the affair of the telegram
that this misunderstanding had made her more charitable
toward others. Though no explanation had yet been given
of the origin of the newspaper article, she no longer believed
Clarissa responsible for it. Ruth was not a snob, and the
fact that Clarissa was now the popular captain of the
basket ball team had had little to do in influencing her.
Neither was she the more anxious to be considered Pamela&rsquo;s
friend because the latter was now the observed of
all observers from having won the great prize open both to
Harvard and Radcliffe students for a thesis on a classical
subject by an honor student. The prize was newly established,
and besides the honor it conferred, the money value
was greater than that of any other prize offered. Pamela&rsquo;s
prospects had greatly brightened. Her scholarship for the
year had covered her tuition, and she had done some
tutoring. But the two hundred and fifty dollars which
the prize would give her would free her from all worry
until she could establish herself as a teacher. Very thankful
was she that she had taken the summer for the special
study and research needed for the thesis. The honor that
she had won through the prize made a great impression on
her relatives in Vermont, and her aunt wrote her a cordial
letter, suggesting that after all they might let bygones be
bygones, and adding that they would be very glad to have
a visit from her as soon as her &ldquo;school&rdquo; was over. Pamela
accepted the invitation, for she longed for a sight of
her old home. But she wrote that it must be July before
she could leave Cambridge. She had promised to stay
with Miss Batson until after the Fourth of July.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>Of all the Seniors in cap and gown Lois was perhaps the
happiest, for it was the first year of her college course in
which she was comparatively free from care. She was
freer than ever before to enjoy the lighter side of college
life. Whether presiding at a business meeting or receiving
at a reception, Lois was greatly admired as President
of the Idler. In fact, she filled the place so well that
many wondered that she had not been thought of a year or
two earlier. Polly, hearing these comments, was greatly
amused by them, and inwardly commended herself for
having brought it about that a girl who had never been
called popular should in her last year of college be near
the pinnacle of popularity. Nothing succeeds like success,
and although Lois in office was just as independent
as Lois out of office had been, yet she now was more at
liberty to mingle with her classmates. The charm of her
manner was realized, therefore, by many, whereas before
it had been felt only by the few with whom she came in
immediate contact.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p>Polly&rsquo;s literary talent which had shown itself in a rather
frivolous form in the operetta had so developed that her
professors had encouraged her to undertake more serious
work. One or two of her poems had appeared in &ldquo;The
Radcliffe Magazine,&rdquo; and had been highly praised. But
this commendation did not mean half as much to her as
the fact that the &ldquo;Advocate&rdquo; had taken one of her short
stories. After it was accepted, some time passed before it
was published, and at first Polly thought that she would
let no one hear of her good fortune until it was actually
in print.</p>
<p>But at last she had to tell Clarissa, and then Clarissa
begged permission to tell Julia, and in a short time all of
Polly&rsquo;s friends knew it. &ldquo;Yet, honestly,&rdquo; said Clarissa,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you are so set up about a little thing
like that. It isn&rsquo;t a bit better to have a story in the
&lsquo;Advocate&rsquo; than in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have it there,&rdquo; said Polly, &ldquo;than in the
&lsquo;Atlantic Monthly,&rsquo; or in any other of the large magazines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Polly Porson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you may see that I am right, because one can
have a thing in the &lsquo;Advocate&rsquo; only during a very limited
time, while she has all her life to get into the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and sometimes it takes a person all her life to
get in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">265</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s well to make sure of the thing near at hand,
like the &lsquo;Advocate&rsquo;&rdquo;, was Polly&rsquo;s response. And linking
her arm in Clarissa&rsquo;s, she walked off with her friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clarissa,&rdquo; she said, as they withdrew out of hearing of
the girls with whom they had been sitting, &ldquo;have you
ever found out about that newspaper article, that one
about Professor Z&rsquo;s notes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not exactly,&rdquo; responded Clarissa. &ldquo;Why do you
ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I have always had a suspicion, and I should
like to verify it, or have it all settled before we leave
college.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should you care? It&rsquo;s all a thing of the
past, and it does not trouble me at all now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say not, but it&rsquo;s a thing I&rsquo;ve set myself to find
out, and, in fact, I almost think that I know who it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Polly, please do not concern yourself about it
on my account. I really do not care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I care, Clarissa. So far as the class is concerned
the thing has come out all right. You&rsquo;ve done so much
for the team that any feeling they might have had would
be wiped away. But&mdash;&rdquo; and here Polly looked rather
inquiringly at Clarissa&mdash;&ldquo;you won&rsquo;t be offended if I say
that there are still some professors and one or two others
in authority who have a prejudice who think that you did
this,&mdash;even Professor Z himself,&mdash;and that is why I want
to clear the thing up. I must tell you who I think it was,
Clarissa. I firmly believe that it was Annabel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still Clarissa was silent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<p>Polly looked at her suspiciously. &ldquo;Upon my word, I
believe that you know who it was. Why won&rsquo;t you
tell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clarissa laughed one of her deep, hearty laughs. &ldquo;You
really are the most inquisitive little person. Surely I have
a right to some secrets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you admit that you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have my own suspicions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was Annabel. You won&rsquo;t say that it was
she, because she is indebted to you. You have a kind
of a manly sense of honor. I don&rsquo;t know what else to
call it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, since you are so persistent, and since you
might make trouble for Annabel, as well as for me, by
telling others of your suspicions&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was Annabel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly, my dear. Do you remember that rehearsal
performance of the Idler when Annabel sang so
long before the curtain went up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, ages ago, when we were Sophomores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, well probably you remember the flowers that fell
with an awful thud on the stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not there myself, but I heard about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you know that they were thrown by Loring
Bradshaw who attended the play dressed as a girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have heard it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the affair made much trouble for him. He was
a Senior, and this was the last of several escapades that
brought him into disfavor with the college authorities.
He was suspended, lost his degree, and although he came
back and took it the next year, he has felt rather bitter
toward me ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<p>&ldquo;Toward you! I did not know he was a friend of
yours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither a friend nor an enemy. But it is true that he
became my enemy because he heard that I had spread the
report of his masquerade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not you at all, Clarissa; it was I who first told
who he was. I remember that distinctly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it was I who had the most to say about that
Mr. Radcliffe affair of Somers Brown. Annabel always
believed that I had something to do with that practical
joke. She still believes, doubtless, that it was purposely
played on her. Naturally, she feels annoyed. But I fear
that her suspicions have carried her too far. However
that may be, I know that my note-book was in her possession
not so very long after this, and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then followed that newspaper article! And you
believe that she had nothing to do with publishing it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that she had less than you think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are more charitable than I could be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beyond this Clarissa would say no more on the subject.</p>

<h2 id="c25">XXV
<br /><span class="small">A STRANGE MEETING</span></h2>
<p>One afternoon soon after the mid-years, Julia was at work
in the stack of Gore Hall, the Harvard Library. For the
past two years she had been delving deep into American
History, and in a certain research course she felt more
interest than in almost any other of her studies. She
hoped before graduating to have accumulated notes enough
for the basis of a monograph. Several such monographs
had been published, under the auspices of Radcliffe, on
other subjects besides history, and they had been praised
for their originality. Julia&rsquo;s chosen subject dealt with the
early history of the country, and at present she was studying
the formation of the government. A special card gave
her access to the great collection of books in the Harvard
Library stack. Her professor suggested the books to be
considered each week, and she submitted her notes to him
and reported what she had read.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<p>On this particular day, surrounded by the many volumes
of &ldquo;Eaton&rsquo;s Debates,&rdquo; she was absorbed in tracing some
difficult point. The long windows of the wing where she
sat let in so much light that she did not realize that it was
growing late. Accordingly as she pushed her way through
the doors into the Main Library she was surprised to find it
deserted of students and attendants. The silence and
gloom were disturbing. There was no doubt but that she
was locked in alone in the great building. What the possibilities
were for her getting out before morning she did
not know. The accessible windows were all too high from
the ground to permit her to jump out, even if she had any
way of opening them. Figures were passing through the
Yard, but she disliked to make a disturbance by knocking on
the glass. If some student should come to her rescue, he
might thoughtlessly mention her plight, and then what joy
for the &ldquo;Lampoon&rdquo; and the daily paper, and any other
publication that enjoyed a chance to laugh at Radcliffe
girls! Julia stood there, looking from the window rather
disconsolately. She did not doubt but that before night
should set in a watchman or a janitor or some one else
would appear on the scene to free her.</p>
<p>But a few hours in the building would be very tiresome,
especially as she had no light, and therefore could not pass
the time reading. An hour, perhaps, went by, and still
Julia saw no way of getting out of the building. She
wondered what Ruth would think when she failed to appear
for dinner. She moved restlessly around the delivery
room, staying as long as possible near the windows. She
hoped that some woman might pass this corner of the Yard,
who would pay attention to her, if she tapped on the window.
But all who approached passed so far from the
Library building that she saw little chance of carrying out
her plan. Had she been there hours or weeks? The unemotional
Julia was actually shedding a tear or two,
though she felt ashamed of herself for her weakness. How
it would have amused Polly to see her usually calm friend
as disturbed as any one else would have been by her misadventure.
After another period of hopeless standing by
the window, Julia&rsquo;s heart gave a sudden bound. A
strangely familiar figure was coming near. But no! It
could not be! Yet it was strange that any one else should
walk with that long, quick step, with head bent after a
fashion that she had not seen in any one for three years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">270</div>
<p>This person, to be sure, wore a soft hat, and he looked a
little heavier than Philip, but no one else could walk in
that way, and Philip had always been devoted to those
short sack coats. Yet Philip was two thousand miles
away, and Julia began to think that her little period of
imprisonment was wearing on her brain. How she ventured
to do it she often wondered afterwards. But jumping
up on the window sill she unfastened the window, and
then jumping down she managed to lift it an inch or two.
The slight noise attracted the attention of the young man
she had observed, who was now standing directly beneath
the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Locked in!&rdquo; she called to him. &ldquo;Could you find some
one to let me out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;at least I&rsquo;ll try; but couldn&rsquo;t
you&mdash;&rdquo; here he seemed to measure the distance with his
eye&mdash;&ldquo;but couldn&rsquo;t you jump out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound of the stranger&rsquo;s voice reassured Julia; he
was certainly Philip, but he had not recognized her. He
probably thought her one of the Library assistants. But
although the distance was not too great for safety it seemed
to Julia unwise to jump. She did not like the idea of attracting
attention; there were likely to be passers-by at any
minute.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;this would really be the
best way. One foot on my shoulder, I&rsquo;ll give you the
word when no one is passing, and you must be quick, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had Julia not known the identity of her rescuer she
probably would not have accepted his offer. But the
prospect of noting his amazement was too good to refuse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do it?&rdquo; he asked a little impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said no more, for she was not yet ready to have him
recognize her. Besides, in the dim light she might have
made a mistake. Watching his chance until there was
absolutely no one in sight of the building, the young man
at last gave the word.</p>
<p>Julia&rsquo;s gymnasium practice was of great service to her
now. Opening the window wider, she sat for a minute on
the sill. Then as she put her foot on Philip&rsquo;s shoulder, by
an adroit movement she maintained her balance while he
knelt low enough to permit her to jump to the ground.</p>
<p>In a second she was on her feet, and no one but Philip
had perceived her strange exit from the building.</p>
<p>Her hat had fallen off, receiving the full force of the jar
of reaching the ground; and Philip, turning to speak to
her, was amazed to find that it was Julia whom he had
assisted. He gave ready answers to her questions, wondering
that she did not know of his intended return.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">272</div>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard from Edith lately,&rdquo; said Julia, &ldquo;and
we have all been so busy with the mid-years that we might
have failed to hear an even greater piece of news than your
coming, although this really is very important,&rdquo; she hastened
to add, lest Philip should think her altogether ungracious.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nearly three years since you went away,&rdquo;
she continued after a moment&rsquo;s silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it? But tell me, Julia, how did you manage to shut
yourself up in the Library? Is it the fashion for Radcliffe
girls to do that kind of thing now? In my day you used
to be more conventional. But we must hurry to a car, you
are hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed I am not,&rdquo; returned Julia. &ldquo;Please let us
walk&mdash;that is, if you have time. They must have finished
dinner at Mrs. Colton&rsquo;s half an hour ago, and I&rsquo;d so much
rather know what you have been doing these three years. I
have only heard general rumors from Edith and the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Philip, nothing loath, gave her a glowing account of
life on the ranch, of the various people he had met and
the things he had learned. &ldquo;It was harder sometimes than
studying,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the life out there. But it did me
good, and now I&rsquo;m going to work in a different way. I&rsquo;ve
promised my father to work for my degree. What a fool
I was to cut those examinations! I&rsquo;ll have a good half-year&rsquo;s
work to make them up. But I may have time for a
little law, too; I&rsquo;ve promised my father to try for the bar.
Even if I do not practise, it will be a good foundation for
business. The old gentleman rather wants me to look
after things and relieve him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">273</div>
<p>Mr. Blair had never been considered an overworked man,
and Julia smiled at the thought of Philip&rsquo;s relieving him.
But Philip to-day was evidently very different from the
Philip of three years before. He no longer spoke in a
drawl and the note of personal vanity was lacking. When
they reached Mrs. Colton&rsquo;s, Philip went indoors with Julia,
and Ruth was louder than Julia had been in her expressions
of surprise at his return to Cambridge. He told the story
of the rescue in a fashion that was amusing, if embarrassing
to Julia. Looking at him as he sat by the droplight
in Mrs. Colton&rsquo;s library, she could see that he had grown
stouter and browner, and that no one could now accuse him
of looking too effeminate.</p>
<p>Ruth and Mrs. Colton congratulated Julia on getting
safely out of the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it wasn&rsquo;t as bad as if you had been in the
Agassiz or Peabody Museums, with stuffed animals and
bottled fishes or old Indian relics to keep you company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m thankful enough,&rdquo; responded Julia; &ldquo;also
that I was rescued without being arrested as an escaped
burglar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That reminds me,&rdquo; said Philip, starting up, &ldquo;that I
must return and see that that window is fastened. I must
hunt up a janitor or something of the kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So almost before they realized it, Philip went off, promising
to call on them soon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">274</div>
<p>Then Ruth and Mrs. Colton insisted on Julia&rsquo;s having
the dinner that they had saved for her; and Julia, thinking
over the happenings of the past two hours, realized that
Philip had neither referred to that last Class Day interview,
nor had he thanked her for her advice nor apologized for
his long silence, and yet she was sure that she and Philip
were better friends than they had ever been before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Julia,&rdquo; said Ruth the next morning, as the two sat in
the conversation room, preparing and looking over some of
the notes of their Shakespeare lesson. &ldquo;Julia, I do not
wonder that Philip and his friends used to laugh at us
just a little when we were Freshmen, if we were at all like
those two meandering through the hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear, we never walked with our arms about
each other&rsquo;s waists, nor scampered through the halls,
nor&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor wore pigtails,&rdquo; continued Ruth, gazing again at
the Freshmen. &ldquo;One of those girls, by the way, Minnie
Crosfut, has been confiding some of her woes and sorrows
to me. She thinks that the upper class girls are not sufficiently
devoted to prayers. She thinks that attendance
should be compulsory, and that it isn&rsquo;t fair for Freshmen
to have more than Seniors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an idea! Freshmen are no more obliged to go
than Seniors. We all know that at ten minutes of nine
every morning there will be prayers in the Auditorium, and
as ministers of three different denominations officiate in
turn, most girls can suit their special theological tastes, but
no one <i>has</i> to go. There are apt to be more Freshmen
there, but I&rsquo;m afraid that the whole thing turns largely on
the question of convenience. Girls who have a nine o&rsquo;clock
recitation are apt to come down here early enough for
prayers. Freshmen from a distance have usually promised
their families before leaving home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic5">

<p class="center">&ldquo;&lsquo;Julia,&rsquo; said Ruth the next morning, as the two sat in the conversation room&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">275</div>
<p>&ldquo;And Pamela?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Pamela comes because she is a minister&rsquo;s daughter,
and because her conscience is always active. But most of
us, I am sure, attend prayers two or three times a week.
Tell your Freshman that she should be more observing.
And now, to work; I am half sorry that we took this Shakespeare
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Julia! You to express such a sentiment! I am
astonished. Why, it seems to me the finest course we have
had this year; at least it has meant more to me. Every
word now in every play that I read seems to have such
depth. I am always looking for the hidden sense. Yet I
do wish that sometimes the meaning were a little plainer.
What do you make of this, &lsquo;Oh, such a deed as from the
body of contraction plucks the very soul&rsquo;? What is
contraction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he gave us the note, &lsquo;Power of making a contract.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I should have written it on the margin, but my
book is so covered with notes that sometimes I trust to
memory. I am anxious to finish this this morning, so as to
be free to enjoy the party this evening, for this afternoon
I am obliged to go to town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, the party, the Sophomores&rsquo; farewell to us. I
wonder what they have planned? I hear that it is to be
something very original. There&rsquo;s Polly with her camera;
perhaps she knows.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p>But Polly, although she had more than a mere idea of
what the Sophomore party would be, declared she was
pledged to secrecy, and she invited Julia and Ruth to go
upstairs with her while she took a picture of the &ldquo;Fair
Harvard&rdquo; room.</p>
<p>This was a recitation room on the second floor, and
Polly had been waiting a time when it should have no
classes, and when the light should be favorable for a photograph.
She meant to have a photograph of every nook
and corner of the old building for the album that she was
making. The &ldquo;Fair Harvard&rdquo; room deserved its name,
for the author of the famous college song had married a
member of the Fay family, and in a room of the old house
he had written the well-known stanzas. His portrait and
an autograph of the poem, now hanging between the windows,
gave the room more interest than belonged to any
other in the whole building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will give me a print?&rdquo; begged Ruth when she
had finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, not one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Polly Porson, are you growing mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, generous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look like it. I have been expecting a whole
set of your photographs. Why do you refuse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come downstairs and I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">277</div>
<p>Julia and Ruth followed Polly to the bulletin board in
the anteroom, whereon were displayed the cards of girls
who were ready to do various things by which they could
earn a little money. There was a notice from one girl that
she was prepared to paint the Radcliffe seal in water colors,
and from another that she would execute the Harvard or
the Radcliffe seals in burnt wood. Other girls advertised
that they were anxious to do mending or typewriting.
One girl offered to frame photographs in passe-partout, and
others to make hand-painted picture frames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; cried Polly, pointing to an excellent photograph
of the Fay House library, with a card stating that
complete sets of Radcliffe views could be obtained from
the girl who had made this print.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I should give my photographs away, I should be
taking money out of her pocket. You and Julia and almost
every girl in the class can easily afford to buy Madge
Burlap&rsquo;s photographs, and I happen to know that she
needs the money. She&rsquo;s one of the girls of whom the
college is bound to be proud. Since she&rsquo;s willing to earn,
she must be encouraged in her efforts. That&rsquo;s why you
can&rsquo;t have my photographs&mdash;for love or money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I accept your apology, Polly, and now good-bye until
this evening.&rdquo; Seizing Julia by the arm, Ruth hurried
her off to the Shakespeare class.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">278</div>
<p>When evening came, the Seniors were welcomed by the
Sophomores at the house of one of their members, whose
house in Cambridge was large and attractive. Across one
side of the long drawing-room was a table covered with a
crimson cloth. When the Sophomores and their guests
had all assembled, a double quartette from the former
class sang an amusing song of greeting, and then at a
given signal the cloth was lifted, and one by one the
Seniors were invited to come forward and gaze upon the
photographs that had been hidden under the cloth. Each
Senior had a book given her in which to record her guess
as to the identity of the girls whose photographs were here
displayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all Seniors,&rdquo; said Madge Burlap, &ldquo;although
you mightn&rsquo;t think it, Seniors at the age of ten or under;
and if you don&rsquo;t recognize yourselves at that age, why we
shall think that you are less clever than you profess to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sophomores had been at work all winter, collecting
the pictures that they now displayed. They had tried to
get them, so far as they could, from friends of the Senior
rather than from the girl herself, as they wished the class
as a whole to be surprised by the collection. Besides
photographs, there were a few miniatures and daguerreotypes,
while of Pamela and one or two other girls there
were only tintypes to show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not asked,&rdquo; said the President of the class,
&ldquo;to say whether the homeliest child has grown into the
prettiest Senior, or the reverse; we shall give the prize
for plain, unvarnished guesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the books were all in, it was found that Pamela
had come the nearest to guessing the whole number,
although even she had made two mistakes. The prize was
an order on the class photographer for a dozen photographs,
and everything considered, perhaps no one could
have appreciated this more than the Vermont girl.</p>
<p>As the spring wore on, the entertainments offered the
Seniors came, as Polly said, &ldquo;fast and furious.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">279</div>
<p>Grateful though the class was for all the attentions
lavished on them, they enjoyed these various parties
much less than the entertainments given them in their
Freshman year. Then four years of college life lay
before them. Now it was nearly all behind; and though
they appreciated the dignity of being Seniors, wearing the
cap and gown, still not a few of them would have given
much to be at the beginning rather than at the end.</p>
<p>Polly was one exception to this sentimentality, which
toward the spring recess seemed to take possession of her
class.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four years more of examinations, a whole year of
English A, a year of daily themes, unexpected hour
examinations in History I, at least two years of superior
smiles from girls who know more than we do,&mdash;no, thank
you! I am very glad to let the dead past bury its dead.
But if any of you really long for four years more, I should
advise you to return for a season of post-graduate work.
Any one who distinguishes herself sufficiently may be the
sword to open the Harvard oyster from which to extract
the Ph.D.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if we could be Freshmen with Seniors&rsquo; experience
life would indeed be ideal, although as it is, it is real and
terribly earnest, and I wonder that we can take time even
in the recess for Julia&rsquo;s house party.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">280</div>
<h2 id="c26">XXVI
<br /><span class="small">THE HOUSE PARTY</span></h2>
<p>When Mrs. Barlow offered Julia the house at Rockley
for a party during the Easter recess, the offer was promptly
accepted. &ldquo;I have ordered the house put in readiness for
our return,&rdquo; wrote Mrs. Barlow from California, &ldquo;although
we shall not reach Boston until the first of May. I am
sure that you must have worked very hard this winter,
and that the breath of sea air will be just what you need
before hot weather sets in. There is room for a dozen
girls, and everything will be arranged for your comfort.
You must not hesitate to ask for whatever you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In making the list of the girls to be invited, Julia and
Ruth were long in consultation. Clarissa and Pamela,
Lois and Polly, were certainties, and there were three or
four others about whom there was no doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Annabel, too,&rdquo; said Julia. &ldquo;We must ask
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth looked closely at her friend. &ldquo;But do you care
to have her? Are you not asking her chiefly on my
account?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">281</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you might like her, even though you and
she are less intimate than you once were. But she is
Class President, and she is much more genuine than she
was a year or two ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She tries to <i>seem</i> more genuine,&rdquo; responded Ruth.
&ldquo;But Annabel can never be absolutely sincere. We must
take her as we find her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we all understand her now,&rdquo; replied Julia, &ldquo;and
as she certainly is entertaining, it seems to me worth while
to invite her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annabel, therefore, was one of the group that sat on
the broad piazzas at Rockley or wandered on the beach in
the warm April sun. Although it was vacation, each girl
had set herself some task to be done before returning to
college. Therefore, for three hours in the morning all
were allowed to bury themselves in their books. Dante,
Schiller, Greek and Latin Classics, Von Holst, Fichte,
Herbert Spencer, John Stuart Mill, Seignobos, and other
awe-inspiring books were strewn over the library table,
although any girl who touched her books except in the
mornings was at once forcibly reprimanded by her classmates.
An exception was made in the case of Polly and
Clarissa, who both were studying practical Astronomy.
So ardent were they in their search for variable stars that
the other girls decided that it would be cruelty to force
them to give up the opportunities afforded by Rockley.
Therefore they spent nearly every evening on a little balcony,
muffled in shawls. The wide, unbroken stretch of
sky gave them the best of views, and, armed with opera-glasses,
they carried on their search with great perseverance.
Clarissa, indeed, announced that she had found
almost enough material for a thesis, and that star-gazing
could be a very profitable performance, &ldquo;when carried on
by a prudent person like myself,&rdquo; she added <i>sotto voce</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">282</div>
<p>For exercise, wheeling was the favorite diversion of the
twelve, and some to whom this part of the country was
new were enthusiastic over the pilgrimages to Salem,
Marblehead, and other historic places. At Salem, where
Amy also was spending her vacation, they had a glimpse
of Mrs. Redmond and her studio. Polly, who had money
for whatever she wished, bought a pretty little water-color
sketch of the beach at Rockley, and Annabel talked
about having her miniature done. Fritz Tomkins, Amy&rsquo;s
great friend, came down to call while the Seniors were
there. He expressed himself as perfectly delighted to
meet a group of Radcliffe girls, explaining that although
he had been a whole year at Harvard, they were the first
students from the woman&rsquo;s college whom he had met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to have called on Ruth and me,&rdquo; said
Julia, with a mischievous attempt at patronizing Fritz,
&ldquo;and we would have introduced you to some one of your
own age. We know several girls in the Freshman class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Fritz, &ldquo;but you know that at Harvard
we hardly realize that there is such an institution as Radcliffe.
It makes so little&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it makes very little disturbance in Cambridge,
and we would hardly realize the existence of Harvard had
we not the advantage of knowing its Faculty pretty well,&rdquo;
retorted Ruth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">283</div>
<p>&ldquo;I understand that you could hardly get on without
them,&rdquo; and thus the good-natured bantering between the
two went on for some time longer, and in the end it was
hard to tell with whom the advantage lay.</p>
<p>One evening at Rockley Julia announced that she had
arranged for a &ldquo;confession conference.&rdquo; She would give
no satisfaction as to her meaning until the whole dozen
had assembled in the library before the open fire.</p>
<p>Then, producing a red-bound book, she declared that its
pages were blank, except that one page in every five had
in turn the names of each of the girls present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to ask each girl to tell me
what Radcliffe has meant to her, and then I am going to
beg her to tell what her real ambition was in coming to
college, or better, what she intends to be when she leaves.
Let us take an hour to collect our thoughts and write;
then another hour to read and discuss what has been
written. Later, with your permission, these confessions
will be handed to the Confession Recorder (and she laid
her hand on Polly&rsquo;s shoulder) to be copied into this book.
I wish that the whole class would do something of the
same kind. But at the end of ten years, how interesting
it will be to see how near we twelve have come to our
ideals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or how far we have fallen below them,&rdquo; murmured a
voice that sounded like that of Annabel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">284</div>
<p>Thus, with pencils and writing pads, the twelve set
to work, for Julia&rsquo;s proposal had the charm of novelty,
and met no opposition. But when the time came for
reading what had been written, the majority of the girls
told what they hoped or planned, without confining themselves
strictly to their notes.</p>
<p>Polly said that she had chosen to come to college
because she was fond of study, and because it had been
her father&rsquo;s pleasure to tutor her in the classics. Out of
a family of five girls, she had thought that one ought to
have as good an education as a boy. &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; she
added, &ldquo;it seemed rather a good joke to shock all our
friends and relations, who thought it a terrible thing for a
girl to go to college. Most people in the South still think
so, although I have converted a few. Papa was a Harvard
man,&rdquo; she added in an undertone, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s why
I came to Radcliffe, and that&rsquo;s all I have to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what have you learned?&rdquo; asked Clarissa. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
part of the game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, everything,&rdquo; responded Polly, &ldquo;but chiefly that
I am not the very brightest girl in the world, as some of
my friends and admirers used to try to make me believe,
when I lived down South.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your ideal?&rdquo; asked Julia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m going to write the great novel of North and
South. The subject is a large one, still I think that I can
conquer it, but it will be years yet,&rdquo; and Polly sighed
heavily&mdash;for Polly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">285</div>
<p>We know how Clarissa and Pamela happened to come to
Radcliffe. Clarissa now confessed that she had learned at
Cambridge that it was a good thing to live in a conventional
place for a time and get the sharp edges rubbed off.
She added that at school she had always been considered
the smartest girl, but Radcliffe, she had found, was made
up of the smartest girls from a good many schools, and
the majority seemed to be able to hold their own quite as
well as she. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with basket ball?&rdquo;
cried two voices in unison from the other side of the
room, and Clarissa hastened to declare her ideal. This
was, she said, to stay quietly at home with her parents
for the next two or three years. &ldquo;They think that I&rsquo;ve
been away too long, but if I really wish a profession at
the end of that time, they will not interfere with my
studying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pamela, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, said that she had
found Radcliffe a most encouraging place, and that instead
of subduing a girl, as Clarissa implied, she thought that it
tended to make her less timid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which shows,&rdquo; interposed Polly, &ldquo;that Radcliffe is
very like the chameleon inspected by several persons, each
of whom gave a different account of the little creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pamela added that she was going to try for a European
Fellowship, and, if possible, spend a year or more at the
American School at Athens.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">286</div>
<p>Lois confessed that the pure love of study had drawn
her to college, and Radcliffe had been her choice, because
while attending it she could also live at home.
&ldquo;Although,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I believe that there is no better
college. Yet I so love study that even without Radcliffe
I should have studied by myself. But college has been
wonderfully broadening for me, especially during the past
year, when I have had so many delightful friends. As to
my ideal,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;I am ashamed to say that my
purpose has changed somewhat. I may not study medicine&mdash;at
least not at present. I am going to teach for
two years, and at the end of that time I shall try to
go abroad for special research in Philosophy. There are
certain theories that I can work out by myself while
teaching and&mdash;after that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lois,&rdquo; cried Esther Haines, one of the group, &ldquo;mark
my words, in two years you will be marching to the altar
to the tune of &lsquo;The Wedding March.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; cried Lois, &ldquo;I am the last one to&mdash;&rdquo; But
the others, noticing that Lois was evidently embarrassed,
could not resist the temptation of teasing her.</p>
<p>In time it was Annabel&rsquo;s turn, and she announced that
she had happened to come to Radcliffe merely because
when on shipboard on her return from Europe she had
met a Harvard man who had told her that this was the
coming college for women, and that it was the thing for
every clever girl to be educated there. &ldquo;&lsquo;Clever,&rsquo;&rdquo; murmured
Polly, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing bashful about Annabel.&rdquo;
The latter added that she wasn&rsquo;t sure that she had
learned as much as she had expected, but for the present
she should rest content, as she meant to devote the next
two or three years to society, as her father had taken a
house in Washington. But just as some of those present
were thinking that Annabel was as vain as ever her tone
changed a little, and she said in a somewhat more humble
voice, &ldquo;To be perfectly honest, I really have learned
some things at Radcliffe, and later in the evening, if you
will let me, I wish to make a little confession of my
own.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">287</div>
<p>As if with one impulse Clarissa and Polly looked at
each other significantly. Her meaning to the others
was not so clear. Even Julia, failing to understand,
hesitatingly gave her impressions of Radcliffe and her
aims.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t tell us your aims in life,&rdquo; cried Clarissa;
&ldquo;to do so would be tautological, as you have been telling
us constantly, ever since you came to college.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Clarissa!&rdquo; and Lois looked almost angry. &ldquo;You
would have us believe that Julia is the most egotistic girl
in the class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not unfair,&rdquo; retorted Clarissa, &ldquo;for you must
agree that Julia is likely to have, after leaving college,
much the same aim that she has had during her college
days,&mdash;that of making every one about her as happy as
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Applause followed Clarissa&rsquo;s explanation, and Julia
withdrew from the room in confusion to order more logs
for the fire.</p>
<p>Ruth had confessed that she had been led to college
from her curiosity as to how she should feel as &ldquo;the new
woman&rdquo; of whom all the newspapers were speaking.
From their columns she judged that a college education
was a very necessary part of this new woman&rsquo;s equipment,
and as she was fond of study she had persuaded
her mother to let her take the Radcliffe course.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">288</div>
<p>&ldquo;Everything considered, you ought to have had a course
in Domestic Economy,&rdquo; said Polly with mischievous
intent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Especially since your aims after college are so very
evident to us all,&rdquo; added Clarissa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I dare say that she&rsquo;ll make just as good a housekeeper.
A college-trained mind is really a very good
possession for a minister&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Polly, Polly, you are incorrigible!&rdquo; exclaimed
Julia, returning at this moment, and handing Ruth a fire
screen to shield her from the gaze of the others. Yet
after all it was generally known that Ruth&rsquo;s engagement
would be announced on Class Day, and she and Will
Hardon were situated so fortunately that the wedding,
Julia knew, might take place within the year.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that almost all the party gave love
of study as their chief reason for choosing college. They
had turned their faces from the pleasantly idle life of the
average American girl, and from seventeen to twenty-one
had been hard workers. Every one of them had sacrificed
something in order to achieve her end, and almost all of
them intended that their education should benefit others.
Although the majority of Julia&rsquo;s guests&mdash;like the majority
of the class&mdash;meant to be teachers, several were looking
forward to other useful work. Even Annabel, in her
secret soul, had an idea that she was to reduce the frothiness
of the social set into which she should be thrown in
Washington. Esther Haines was one of the few who
proposed a definite career of altruism. She was to spend
her first year after graduating in the College Settlement in
the east side of New York. She said that after her year&rsquo;s
experience she would know whether or not it was wise to
become the agent of some charitable organization. She
had an idea that she might prefer the foreign field.
Esther was one of the class whom Julia had come to know
best in her Senior year. The latter often regretted that her
acquaintance with Esther had come so late in her course,
for Esther was not a pale, dyspeptic altruist, but one of the
cheerful, rosy-cheeked kind, and it was easy to see that her
mission to the poor would be one of joy and hopefulness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">289</div>
<p>Of the whole group Madge Burlap was the one, perhaps,
who had had the hardest time in planning her
course, for early in her Sophomore year her father had
died, and at first it had seemed as if she must leave college.
Instead of wealth, she now had nothing but a few
hundred dollars in the bank and many books, pictures, and
personal belongings. These things she gradually sold&mdash;so
gradually that she did not draw on herself the pity
of her classmates. It had been hard to part with that
morocco-bound edition of Stevenson, at a time when her
English instructor was urging them all to an intimacy
with the great Scotchman. But after all, with the
money in her pocket and the books on Julia&rsquo;s shelves,
she was not so very badly off; for in negotiating for
the sale of the Stevenson, her pleasant acquaintance
with Julia had deepened into friendship. It had been
harder to part with her Ruskin, for this set had been
divided, Polly taking &ldquo;The Stones of Venice,&rdquo; Annabel
&ldquo;The Seven Lamps of Architecture,&rdquo; and one or two
others taking the rest. Madge was a good business
woman, and she disposed of all her superfluous belongings
except her camera. Yet that could not be counted a
superfluity, since she made it pay for itself many times
over, and her artistic views of Cambridge and the surrounding
country were beginning to be in demand at one
or two well-known stationers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">290</div>
<p>&ldquo;We know that you are a business woman and a photographer,
and since you won&rsquo;t tell us your exact aim, I
prophesy that you will make a fortune, Madge, in artistic
photography,&rdquo; said Polly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why not?&rdquo; responded Madge, thinking of the
three young brothers whom she was helping educate. &ldquo;A
fortune in our family would be both useful and ornamental.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last each girl of Julia&rsquo;s party had read her confession,
and the others had given their approval. Each in
turn had promised Julia to record what she had written or
said in the crimson-covered blank-book, as a beginning of
the archives to which the exercises of Class Day and Commencement
were bound to add so much. It was then that
Annabel&rsquo;s clear voice was again heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not forget <i>my</i> confession, although it is not
for the red book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then, let&rsquo;s hear it,&rdquo; cried Madge Burlap, and the
others echoed her wish. It happened that the group was
now sitting in a semicircle around the fire. Annabel was
in the centre, and as she spoke the others turned instinctively
toward her. It suited her to be the centre of
interest, and she began very dramatically:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">291</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course every one here remembers the afternoon
when I recited so many things before the curtain went up,
that afternoon two years ago when we had to wait so long
for the Idler play to begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annabel knew, naturally, that every one present <i>did</i>
remember that day, and she continued: &ldquo;You may recall,
too, that there was much discussion afterwards about a
strange girl who attended the performance&mdash;who&mdash;who
threw me a very large bouquet. Well, perhaps some of
you may also have heard that the girl was Loring Bradshaw
in disguise, who took that way of seeing a Radcliffe
play. I recognized him, of course, but for certain reasons
he did not wish any one else to know that he had done
this. He was a little under a cloud in college, and he
thought that this wouldn&rsquo;t do him any good with the
Faculty. Well, the affair <i>did</i> get out, and he always
thought that this was the last straw that led to his suspension.
He knew that I had not told, and he was sure that
no man in college would have done so. Then, I happened
to mention that you, Miss Herter, had spoken of it at Radcliffe,
and he looked on you as the cause of his troubles with
Harvard. So it happened one day that he walked home
with me as I was carrying your note-book in History 100
that I had borrowed. Your name was in large letters on the
cover, and he insisted on carrying the book away. I could
not prevent him, for he simply took it from me. I wrote
him a severe letter that night, and the book came back to
me promptly the next day. He said that it had served
his purpose, but I had no idea of his meaning until that
newspaper article appeared. I did not care to tell people
that Loring was undoubtedly responsible, and besides,
just then, Miss Herter, I was perfectly willing to have it
appear that you were to blame. They were certainly your
notes, and I had no way of proving that Loring had concocted
the article.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">292</div>
<p>There was silence when Annabel finished. Before any
one else could speak, she continued: &ldquo;I wish to say now
that I am very sorry that I let so many hold a wrong
opinion, for of course I knew that they held it. But I was
annoyed about this, although I know now that Polly and
Clarissa had nothing to do with the Mr. Radcliffe affair as
I thought at first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; cried Polly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve realized for some time that I do not deserve
to be Class President. In fact, even before Clarissa rescued
me I had begun to see that I was a mean and jealous kind
of a person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! there!&rdquo; exclaimed Polly, rising to her feet,
&ldquo;we won&rsquo;t allow too much humility in the President of
the class. We&rsquo;ve all made some mistakes of judgment,
and I myself have been about the worst of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; continued Annabel, &ldquo;you are too good, but I
have learned more than any one else in finding out that
girls can be generous to one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; cried Clarissa, taking her place beside Polly.
&ldquo;In the language of the poet, &lsquo;Enough said.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clarissa disliked scenes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">293</div>
<h2 id="c27">XXVII
<br /><span class="small">NEARING CLASS DAY</span></h2>
<p>As Class Day approached, the class began to feel that
the end was indeed near at hand. Thoughtful girls like
Julia and Lois found a special significance in everything
that they did; &ldquo;for the last time&rdquo; meant a great deal to
them, and even the unsentimental Clarissa quoted Tennyson
with an approach to correctness:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Tears, idle tears, I know not why ye fall,&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Tears from the depth of some divine despair.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>During May the class had had many attentions paid it
by the other undergraduates, as well as by different professors
and their wives,&mdash;&ldquo;a continuous performance,&rdquo; as
Polly phrased it, of farewells; and that girl would indeed
have been stony-hearted who had not felt that all these
things had made her parting with Cambridge a little
harder. There had come a lull in these festivities during
the examination season of early June, for in comparison
with all other examination periods this one had an enormous
importance for many Seniors. Even girls who had
done well throughout their course showed an unnecessary
nervousness, and were sincere in fearing that in some
unexpected way they might lower their records. Few of
them, perhaps, expected to fail, but those girls who had
set their hearts on a degree <i>summa cum</i>, <i>magna cum</i>, or
even simply <i>cum laude</i>, felt that much depended on the
marks of these final examinations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_294">294</div>
<p>But when the examinations were at an end, worry, too,
departed, and few indeed were the Seniors who did not
enter whole-heartedly into the pleasures of these last days.</p>
<p>The work of the various class committees had been
completed some weeks before, and to the credit of the
class all had worked together harmoniously. Even in
the election of the committees most little rivalries and
jealousies had disappeared, and if in all instances precisely
the right girl was not in the right place, no one criticised
or found fault. As Class President Annabel was Chairman
of the General Committee, Ruth of the Invitation
Committee, Julia was Chairman of the Committee on
Class Exercises, Clarissa was chief of the Photograph
Committee, and Pamela, in spite of her protestations, had
a place on the Baccalaureate Committee.</p>
<p>So energetic had Clarissa been as Chairman of her committee
and so conscientious in securing the best photographs
that some of her classmates made really pathetic
complaints.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">295</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes, when I think that I am going to have an
hour of leisure, an hour when I may sink in the depths
of my easy-chair and refresh myself with Meredith,&mdash;George,
not Owen,&mdash;there comes a gentle tapping at the
door, and I rise to receive a note reminding me that I am
part of a group that is to be photographed under the
broiling noon sun, and that I am especially requested to
wear a pleasanter expression than usual. I belong to so
many groups,&rdquo; concluded Polly sadly, &ldquo;that my Senior
May has been one long noonday glare of sittings before
the camera. When there was nothing else happening,
some amateur was taking a snap-shot, to add me to her
album of Radcliffe views. I cannot tell you how many
times I have been caught in unconscious attitudes, crossing
the tennis court, or leaning against a tree, or seated
on the steps. I always try to look my best at such times,
because&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You spoke of <i>unconscious</i> attitudes,&rdquo; commented a listening
Junior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, child! When you are a Senior you will understand
things better,&rdquo; replied the irrepressible Polly; &ldquo;and
to prevent further criticism, I will give you a specimen of
my most unconscious smile,&rdquo; and the younger girl accepted
Polly&rsquo;s latest photograph&mdash;a full length in cap and
gown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My time for teasing you, Polly, will come to-morrow,&rdquo;
said the Junior, &ldquo;for you may be my vis-&agrave;-vis in a canoe,
and if you are not careful I may tip you&mdash;just a little way&mdash;into
the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Polly refused to be frightened by this mild threat,
and when the canoe set out it was Polly who held the
paddle. This excursion on the river was the form into
which the Juniors offered their hospitality to the departing
class, and a merry time they had with a picnic supper
spread in a grove on the river bank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_296">296</div>
<p>The Sophomores invited the Seniors to a dramatic performance
in the open air, after which&mdash;for almost the last
time as undergraduates&mdash;the guests were treated to the
familiar fudge and college ice. If the fudge was over-sweet
and the ice over-watery, nobody criticised the feast.
Indeed, the affair was considered remarkably successful,
since the Sophomores were thought to have been extremely
clever in having discovered that the Radcliffe
grounds were large enough for such festivity. All the
audience, to be sure, except the Seniors, had sat pretty
closely together on rugs and shawls spread on the grass.
But the Seniors in their camp chairs were not crowded;
and though the setting of the mimic stage was rather
Shakespearian in its simplicity, it sufficed for the little
play. For the whole action was supposed to take place on
the links where two golfers engaged in some sentimental
sparring, and a caddie and a country maid furnished the
burlesque element.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_297">297</div>
<p>Of all the events of that last month none was more
enjoyable than the reception given by the Athletic Association
to the Senior basket ball team, as a special acknowledgment
of its prowess in gaining the championship.
For Clarissa and her nine had not only vanquished the
younger classes, but had won certain victories over outside
colleges that had almost turned the heads of the athletically
inclined. Indeed, some of those girls who seldom set
foot in the Gymnasium except when obliged to exercise
went to this reception to honor the team. For it was the
proud boast of the athletes that no girl on the team would
have a degree graded lower than <i>cum laude</i>, and thus the
outside world would see that mental and physical exercise
could go on at the same time. As for Clarissa&mdash;well,
every one knew that she showed marked ability in everything
that she undertook, and no one, not even Annabel,
grudged her her honors. To her undoubtedly belonged the
chief credit for the glory that came to the class in bearing
away the banner of championship. This was more than a
compensation for their losses in the tennis tournament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Few classes,&rdquo; said Polly proudly, &ldquo;will go out in a
greater blaze of glory. With Clarissa getting us the
championship, and Pamela winning that two hundred and
fifty dollar thesis prize, all eyes will be turned upon us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They always are turned on the graduating class,&rdquo;
responded Julia, to whom she spoke. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s delightful,
is it not, that these special honors have come through
girls to whom some of us were not inclined to pay much
attention in our Freshman year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Some of us&rsquo; is good,&rdquo; rejoined Polly, &ldquo;when we
remember that you always had unlimited confidence in the
two heroines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always liked them,&rdquo; said Julia quietly, &ldquo;as I saw
that others must when they knew them better.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">298</div>
<p>To picture the scene in the Gymnasium demands the
painter&rsquo;s brush rather than the pen, for it was no formal
reception such as any group of girls could give in any
house. Far from it! Though the day was fairly warm,
the star athletes did their best for the entertainment of
their guests. They performed feats that made the blood
of some of the uninitiated run cold. They went up and
down ladders, and climbed ropes, and swung on rings,
and leaped over bars, and showed enormous agility, if they
undertook no difficult tests of strength.</p>
<p>Those girls who were not in the R. A. A. stood about
in their light muslin gowns, and clapped and cheered a
steady approval; and the others in their picturesque gymnasium
suits clapped and cheered even more loudly. They
did not shriek, not they, when Clarissa at the apex of a
pyramidal arrangement of ladders seemed about to fall.
They knew that she was safe, and Clarissa was soon ready
for her triumphant descent.</p>
<p>But some of the girls in light gowns <i>did</i> exclaim at the
critical moment in tones loud enough to have frightened a
timid gymnast, and some thought it a pity that Clarissa
should have to work so hard when she was really the
guest of honor, and some thought that she was making a
needless display of her prowess. Yet as Clarissa poised
herself at the top of the ladder before starting down, a
mighty cheer went up from the whole throng, and Clarissa,
with beaming eyes and flushed cheeks, waved them
her appreciation of their appreciation before beginning the
descent.</p>
<p>After the banner had been duly presented, after the
team had made its acknowledgment, after every one who
could make a speech had said the proper thing, the
R. A. A. returned to everyday costume, and the three
or four hundred girls wandered about the grounds until
summoned to college ice in the Auditorium.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_299">299</div>
<p>For Julia the spring had an added charm from the fact
that Philip took so much interest in everything. Though
working for his degree, he was constantly planning little
parties of eight or a dozen to see this or that baseball
game or the spring athletic meets. Whoever the others
might be, Julia was always of the party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not known so much of Harvard doings in all
my four years,&rdquo; she said one day as they set out for a
Princeton game, &ldquo;and I feel foolishly frivolous in my old
age.&rdquo; There was no sign of old age in the bright-eyed
girl who waved the Harvard flag, even up to the moment
of Princeton&rsquo;s victory. The general excitement, and the
fact that it was a Princeton game, reminded Julia of that
other Princeton game more than five years before when
Harvard was victorious at football, and when Philip had
shown himself just a little bored by having to escort a
&ldquo;parcel of girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus with some pleasant diversions lightening the unescapable
hard work of the examination period, the spring
passed away, and the Monday before Class Day found the
whole class ready to enjoy the happenings of the week.
To Julia early that Monday morning came a note from
Philip saying that his degree was assured, and that he
had nothing to trouble him now except the fear that she
might not get hers. Julia smiled as she read the friendly
little note, and thought how greatly Philip had changed
from the Philip of old.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_300">300</div>
<p>The first event of the day was a luncheon given by
the former Secretary of the Annex and Regent of Radcliffe
and his wife, at their Cambridge house. To them
more than to any others was due the credit of planning the
collegiate work for women that had finally resulted in
establishing Radcliffe College. The Secretary was always
ready to answer the many questions asked by the eager girls
about the small beginnings of the college, and to the more
thoughtful it was a wonderfully interesting story.</p>
<p>After the luncheon Annabel was called upon for a
speech, and she was followed by half a dozen others, each
of whom were ready-witted in responding to the impromptu
toasts.</p>
<p>From the luncheon they went on to a reception at Craigie
House. The poet&rsquo;s daughter had also been one of the
founders of the college, and the girls or classes honored
with an invitation to Craigie House were always envied
by the others.</p>
<p>Clarissa and Pamela, on this afternoon of the class reception,
in a spirit of veneration, went almost on tiptoe into
the study, now looking just as Longfellow left it almost
twenty years ago. There near a window overlooking the
Charles they saw the high writing desk at which he wrote
standing, with some of his quill pens lying on it. They
noted the great orange tree in the other window that had
grown from a seed planted by Longfellow. The portraits
of Hawthorne and Emerson, and the little water-color
sketch of the village blacksmith&rsquo;s shop, all came in for
their share of attention. But perhaps most interesting of
all was the portrait of the poet himself, in his fur-trimmed
coat, painted by his son, on an easel near the fireplace.
The class wandered from the quaintly furnished room
known as Martha Washington&rsquo;s parlor to the large drawing-room
back of the study, with its many art treasures
gathered in Europe. They strolled over the broad lawn,
and each girl felt that this reception at the Longfellow
House was something that no other event of Commencement
week could surpass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_301">301</div>
<p>Their own Class Day was the Wednesday before that of
Harvard, and in the intervening day or two the class had
little time to spare. The invitations had been out since
the end of May, and all the preparations had been carefully
made.</p>
<p>The literary exercises took place in the forenoon, with
only the class as audience. &ldquo;Thankful enough we ought
to be,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;that cut and dried speeches in a hall
have not yet been adopted by Radcliffe. It would be so
hard to have to explain our jokes even to our sympathetic
friends and relatives, and there would always be some
present who would think undignified any alleged witticisms
that we might offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure, therefore, of a friendly audience, Annabel gave
the Class History, and Polly the Class Prophecy. Ruth
had written the words of a Class Song for which Julia had
composed the music. There was a Class Poem by Estelle
Ambler, a girl whose verses had lately appeared in several
of the magazines, and it was rumored that Clarissa was to
make an original contribution to the programme which no
one was to know about until the last moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_302">302</div>
<p>Annabel&rsquo;s History was even cleverer than her classmates
had expected. She reviewed brightly the various events
of the undergraduate years, scholastic and athletic, with
the usual gentle gibes at History I and English 22, and
the trials offered by Junior forensics and daily themes;
and she made all laugh by the originality of her class
statistics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are 1,378 years old,&rdquo; she read from her manuscript,
&ldquo;2,942 feet high, and we weigh a little less than
four tons. During our four college years we have studied
26,134,720 minutes, and at Mrs. Agassiz&rsquo; Wednesday
afternoons we have drunk in all about 7,000 cups of tea.
During our four years we have used about 260 pints or
32.5 gallons of ink, and 5,636,250 pages of theme paper,
which would cover about 5,000,000 square inches. The
actual time spent in writing examinations has been just 96
days, of 24 hours each. For this work 5,240 blue-books
have been necessary, and 320 quarts of Mrs. Hogan&rsquo;s beef
tea. In listening to lectures we have spent 30,000 hours,
or 1,800,000 minutes. The Secretary knows that we have
been eager searchers for knowledge, for at the lowest estimate
we have asked her 2,470 questions, to which she has
returned 2,470 patient and obliging answers. Now that
we are about to depart to the four corners of the earth, we
shall never forget old Radcliffe, nor the blue-books, even
though we forget what filled them. We shall always
remember the honored President and the Dean and the
Secretary, and all who have smoothed our path here for
us, and we shall never forget that we shall always belong
to the Class of 189&mdash; of Radcliffe College.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_303">303</div>
<p>A Class Poem can never be very original, but Estelle
Ambler offered one that was extremely smooth and pleasing,
and to the point. Polly followed it with a Prophecy,
in which she imagined all kinds of things likely to happen
to the rest of the class. &ldquo;Prophecies contrary to fact,&rdquo;
many of them might have been called, for Polly foretold
the early marriage of several of those girls who were the
least devoted to society and the most devoted to study,
while for Annabel and Ruth and Clarissa she prophesied
many long years of toil as teachers or professors in school
or college. Business careers were foretold for the unpractical,
and those girls gifted with a sense of humor had
a chance, in Polly&rsquo;s gentle satire, to see themselves as
others had seen them; and they all smiled at her concluding
words, which she said embodied the sentiments of
most of those inclined to give advice to college girls that
the main advantage of a college education for a woman
is that it fits her, or ought to fit her, &ldquo;to take up the
duties and responsibilities of a household, that by bringing
her accurately trained mind to bear upon the practical details
of life, and exercising the acquired acumen of her
mind, she can make homes happier than they ever were
before, and&mdash;&rdquo; The final words were lost in the applause
that greeted this familiar commonplace; and Polly, acknowledging
a wreath of roses laid at her feet, bowed
gracefully as she descended from the Auditorium stage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_304">304</div>
<p>There was a hum of expectation as Clarissa followed
Polly on the stage, carrying a large, stiff-looking roll.
Unfolding it, she announced that she had been made Class
Attorney, and that to her had been intrusted the making
of the Class Will, which she would now read.</p>
<p>The things that she bequeathed were chiefly the common
property of the class, such as &ldquo;the superior smile
when some underclass girl asks a question that cannot be
answered;&rdquo; to the incoming Freshman class the &ldquo;privilege
of profiting by the advice which their Senior advisers will
give upon every occasion;&rdquo; and last, though not least, in
the minds of some, &ldquo;the privilege of collecting on the
slightest provocation sums of money, great or small, in
exchange for tickets to entertainments, or without such
consideration, to support divers good causes in Boston and
Cambridge, especially those connected with settlement and
college work; and the less ready money any girl is supposed
to have, the more urgent shall be the appeals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the Sophomores among other things were given the
right of assuming &ldquo;the nonchalant title of Junior,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;the faculty and right of saying to Seniors who are loath
to depart this college life, &lsquo;Oh, well, we have a whole year
more,&rsquo; in a way that makes a year sound an eternity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Senior rights in various college officials and in
certain college properties were likewise bequeathed, and
the mock solemnity of the whole thing brought the programme
to a close with a chorus of laughter. Then after
the class had sung Julia&rsquo;s Class Song, there was an informal
half-hour of choruses and solos, and then a great hurrying
homeward, that each girl might have an hour of rest before
the grand climax of the day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_305">305</div>
<p>For some of the class, however, there could be no rest,
as many, besides those on the committees, were anxious to
do their part in helping. But beautiful though the decorations
of Fay House were, they paled into insignificance
before the outdoor glories, for clever brains and skilful
hands had made the most of the opportunities afforded by
the limited area of the grounds. There were lines of
lanterns between the trees, and a wonderful pagoda that
seemed to be constructed of lanterns; there were tables on
the lawns, laden with refreshments, and each Senior shook
hands with dozens of persons and answered scores of
questions, and had little opportunity to talk with the
person she most wished to talk with, and walked ten
miles more or less showing each of her special guests the
points of interest in and around the college buildings.
Each Senior, too, looked her very best in her simple
white gown, and the crowds of Harvard students who
were in attendance testified that socially at least Radcliffe
was in no way unpopular with the older college. So
weary were the Seniors as the evening advanced that they
had little strength left to dance in the new Gymnasium.
But the undergraduates and their other guests made up
for their own lack in this respect.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_306">306</div>
<p>Pamela had invited Miss Batson and all the young
ladies who boarded with her, and probably no guests enjoyed
the day more than they. Besides her own family
and some of her younger Newton friends, Lois invited
Miss Ambrose, and those who were in the secret of Miss
Ambrose&rsquo;s aspirations could see that through her interest
in Lois her own youth had been renewed. There was a
rumor that she and Lois were to go to Europe that summer,
and whether that was true or not, any one seeing
them together could perceive that the feeling between
them was stronger than that of mere friendliness. Clarissa&rsquo;s
father and mother had come on from Kansas, and
several of her friends and relatives from the West.
Annabel&rsquo;s father, a New York politician, was so pleased
that his daughter had retained the Presidency of the class
that he was anxious to do all kinds of pleasant things for
her constituents, and had finally arranged a mammoth pop
concert party for Saturday evening. Julia, like the other
Boston girls, had many guests, but the Bostonians were
better able to entertain themselves than those who came
from a distance.</p>
<p>Julia, for example, felt little responsibility for her uncle
and aunt. They had many friends on the grounds, as had
Nora and Edith and the rest of their party. She caught
glimpses of Brenda constantly flitting about in her firefly
fashion, with Arthur Weston in attendance. It was an
open secret that Brenda&rsquo;s engagement to Arthur was to
come out before Commencement, and those who knew
them the best had already offered the young people their
congratulations. Many of the class, too, knew that Ruth
and Will Hardon were also on the verge of having their
engagement announced, and an observer might have
thought that there was something more than good comradeship
in the devotion with which Philip followed Julia
from place to place. Julia had used not only the invitations
to which she was entitled as a member of the class,
but she had been able to secure many in addition from
girls who did not need all their own allotment. She was
able, therefore, to invite not only her former classmates at
Miss Crawdon&rsquo;s, but the teachers, too. Miss South was
there in the light mourning that she wore for Madame
Dulaunay. Those who knew her were wondering what
she would do with the great house that her grandmother
had left her, which it would be hard to keep up on a
comparatively small income.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_307">307</div>
<p>Of all those whom Julia had known best at Miss Crawdon&rsquo;s
school, Belle alone was missing. By this it need
not be understood that any one really missed her, for
Belle, since she had been sent to New York to boarding-school,
had really dropped out of the little set in which
she had once been a leading member. In vacations some
of her new friends visited her or she visited them, and
she laughed at the ways of her Boston contemporaries as
&ldquo;far behind the time.&rdquo; She and Brenda always kept up
a correspondence, and her letters, though wholly about
herself, were always entertaining. She had already left
Boston to stay with friends at Mount Desert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why Radcliffe College?&rdquo; asked one of Polly&rsquo;s
guests, her cousin from New York.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, where did you get that name?&rdquo; asked another
cousin, walking with her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_308">308</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, from Lady Anne Moulson, of course,&rdquo; responded
Polly, not at all unwilling to tell the story.
&ldquo;From Lady Anne Moulson, who was once Anne Radcliffe,
and who founded the first scholarship at Harvard.
The fact was unearthed just as the poor little nameless
Annex was ready to appear out as a regular institution,
and so she was christened Radcliffe College. Some did
not care for the name, and would have preferred Longfellow
College or something else local, but on the whole it
seemed the best that could have been chosen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust that Lady Moulson deserved the posthumous
fame that has come to her, for certainly your college will
give her name undying glory,&rdquo; said one of the cousins
gallantly in true Southern fashion, though he modified
his praise slightly lest Polly should think that he wholly
approved of a college education for girls.</p>
<p>To show herself impartial, Julia carried Tom Hearst&rsquo;s
flowers as well as Philip&rsquo;s on Class Day. But it was
Philip with whom she walked about the grounds after her
duties as hostess were over, and Philip with whom she
promised to go to Memorial Hall on the evening of Harvard
Class Day, and Philip who was to be her escort at
the Yale game the succeeding Saturday. Yet though
they had many little conversations, and although what
they said was largely personal, it must be admitted that
there was not a word of sentiment in it all,&mdash;of sentiment,
at least, as it is understood in its more romantic sense.
They did talk, however, a great deal about their plans for
the immediate future. Philip had decided to regard his
father&rsquo;s wishes, by taking his two years in the Law
School, hoping that his previous reading and some special
effort would take him through in less than three years.
Julia confided to him certain ideas that she and Miss
South hoped to carry out in the form of a training school
for girls of the Angelina type. Philip&rsquo;s face clouded
when she told him that she should sail for Europe in July,
with her uncle and aunt and Brenda and Miss South.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_309">309</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll be back in the autumn?&rdquo; urged Philip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, possibly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m depending on you for advice and that kind of
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Edith is a better adviser than I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but Edith isn&rsquo;t a college graduate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor am I yet,&rdquo; and Julia would give Philip no further
satisfaction. Instead she wandered off, with a hasty good-bye
to Philip, explaining only that as one of the hostesses
of the day, she must look after her other guests.</p>
<p>Philip, following her, soon found himself in a group of
which the central figure was Pamela. The two had not
met since the spring following the sugar episode, and
altogether had seen each other but two or three times.
Yet now the recognition was mutual, and both had instantly
the same thought, that each had greatly improved
during the intervening three years. He lingered to talk to
Pamela, and he had no chance to talk to Julia until later
in the evening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_310">310</div>
<p>Although Philip felt dissatisfied, Julia had really given
him more time than most Seniors had given to any one
person on that busy, busy Class Day. Yet he kept his
eye on her, and whenever he could induce her to leave her
other guests, he would get her to walk with him over
the building or through the grounds, on the pretext that
there were many things that he wished to have explained
about Radcliffe ways. Together Julia and Philip watched
the gay throng of dancers in the Auditorium, and in an
interval when the latter laughed at the crowded condition
of the floor, Julia repeated the rumor that the next Senior
class would dance in the great Gymnasium, as those in
authority had already given their consent to this plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be the proper thing, because&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; cried Julia, &ldquo;the Glee Club is going to sing;&rdquo;
and as she spoke, to the air of &ldquo;Fair Harvard&rdquo; floated the
words:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Now a song for our Radcliffe, so young and so fair,</p>
<p class="t">With the light of the dawn in her eyes,</p>
<p class="t0">With the garlands of May in her beautiful hair,</p>
<p class="t">Blest child of the true and the wise.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>As the song finished, Mrs. Barlow approached Julia, to
remind her that the hour was late, and that the two carriages
were already waiting,&mdash;one to take the Barlow
party back to Boston, and one to convey Julia and Ruth
to Mrs. Colton&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>As Julia and Ruth drove homeward, the former gave a
sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you glad it&rsquo;s over?&rdquo; asked Ruth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Partly glad and partly sorry,&rdquo; responded her friend.
&ldquo;It has been tiring, of course, but then so pleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and to-morrow when we are rested, we shall be
sorry that Class Day is past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry now,&rdquo; returned Julia, &ldquo;for it marks the
beginning of the end.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_311">311</div>
<h2 id="c28">XXVIII
<br /><span class="small">COMMENCEMENT&mdash;AND THE END</span></h2>
<p>As Julia sat in church on Baccalaureate Sunday she felt
sadder than on any occasion since the class had begun to
take its farewell of Cambridge and of college life, for
now they were together for the last time before Commencement
as the Senior class in cap and gown.</p>
<p>The last day was near at hand, and after that final
assembling in Sanders Theatre, it was unlikely that these
threescore girls would ever be all together again in the
same place. Impressive though the sermon was, more
than once Julia had to recall her thoughts from wandering
in a review of the past four years. Had she herself made
the best use of her time? Was there not some girl among
the Seniors to whom she might have been more helpful
than she had been&mdash;in ways intangible if not material?
Had she herself drawn all the inspiration she might have
drawn from her classmates? She had learned much from
her intimates, but had she been sufficiently appreciative of
some of the others or responsive to them? Thoughts like
these so mingled themselves with her impressions of the
sermon that she left the church in a state of abstraction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_312">312</div>
<p>Questions such as Julia had asked herself can never
receive a definite answer. The wisest of us makes many
mistakes, and the most foolish would be plunged in constant
despair if she had to call herself to account at every
step. To do her best is the most that can be asked of any
girl, and if only she tries to learn from her errors, whatever
her past faults, she can turn hopefully to the future.</p>
<p>Julia, fortunately, had comparatively little occasion for
self-reproach; for if she had made the very most of her
opportunities at Radcliffe&mdash;if she had left nothing undone
that should have been done&mdash;she would have been the
only one of her kind. Thoughts like these of Julia&rsquo;s
presented themselves to nearly every girl in the class&mdash;from
Pamela the over-conscientious to careless Polly.
Even the self-sufficient Annabel talked in a less self-satisfied
manner, as she walked homeward from church
accompanied by two or three of her best friends.</p>
<p>The three days intervening between Class Day and
Baccalaureate Sunday had been very full. Friday had
been Harvard Class Day, and there wasn&rsquo;t a girl in the
class who did not know at least one Harvard Senior. It
was the first Class Day for Julia since the year of Philip&rsquo;s
failure, and the things that she did seemed a repetition of
the happenings of that other year. There was but one
marked change: the Tree exercises had been given up,
and a less strenuous performance went on around the John
Harvard statue on the delta. Confetti took the place of
flowers, and the whole affair was carried on in the most
gentlemanly way. Yet Julia, like many others, thought
with regret of the old struggle around the Tree&mdash;regret
that it was to be no more. Philip, although he realized
better than any one else that this was not his real Class
Day, yet managed to get a great deal of fun out of it.
Tom Hearst and some of his former classmates, now about
to be graduated from the Law School, gave a small tea in
the early evening, and it proved a reunion of the group of
young people who had been together so much at Rockley
and in Boston. Brenda&rsquo;s engagement had come out that
very day, and she and Arthur Weston received the congratulations
showered on them in a fashion that amused
every one. They were surprised that their friends were
not surprised.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_313">313</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure that I have always complained of the way
Arthur teased me,&rdquo; pouted Brenda, &ldquo;and I never <i>really</i>
made up my mind until&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo; shouted Tom Hearst, noting with delight
that Brenda was embarrassed. But Brenda refused to
answer.</p>
<p>Ruth and Will Hardon had an equally large share of congratulations,
and they would have been astonished had their
friends not taken their engagement as a matter of course.</p>
<p>On Saturday the same group of young people went to
the Yale-Harvard game on Soldier&rsquo;s Field, and after they
had returned home from Annabel&rsquo;s concert party, Ruth and
Julia were tired enough.</p>
<p>Kaleidoscopic visions of the past week&rsquo;s festivities
mingled with Julia&rsquo;s more serious thoughts that Baccalaureate
Sunday, as she scratched off the dates on her
calendar that showed only two days remaining of college
life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_314">314</div>
<p>But at last the eventful Tuesday had come&mdash;the Commencement
that was to end the undergraduate days of the
class. They had breakfasted that morning with the Dean,
and had met many of their instructors at the informal
reception that followed. Commencement was at half-past
four o&rsquo;clock, and promptly at that hour, while the orchestra
in the gallery was playing, a long procession filed into
Sanders Theatre. The amphitheatre was already filled
with guests who had been ushered to their seats by Harvard
Seniors. At the head of the procession walked the
President of Harvard, and on his arm leaned the President
of Radcliffe&mdash;stately and benign. Close behind were the
Dean, the Secretary, the members of the Governing Board
of Radcliffe and the Overseers of Harvard, with whose
approval the degrees were granted.</p>
<p>All these took their seats on the platform, and at the
left sat the Radcliffe Glee Club. The Seniors in cap and
gown at the end of the procession marched to places on
the floor of the theatre directly under the stage. It was
hard for them to maintain their dignity without turning
around, when they knew that in the balconies were so
many of those with whom they would have liked to exchange
a glance and a nod.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_315">315</div>
<p>After the prayer, and the singing of &ldquo;Integer Vit&aelig;&rdquo;
by the Glee Club, the President of Radcliffe congratulated
the class on their four years&rsquo; work, and on the special
honors that had come to some of them. She told of the
improving prospects of the college, and mentioned several
gifts that had been made during the year. The most important
news was the statement that one generous donor
had given the whole sum needed to build a handsome
dormitory,&mdash;the first Radcliffe dormitory,&mdash;and at this
news there was loud applause.</p>
<p>The address that followed by the President of Harvard&mdash;a
dignified and scholarly address&mdash;showed deep sympathy
with the aims of college girls, many of whom had gained
their degrees at the cost of certain things that most young
girls might think more attractive. He called attention to
the fact that the experiment of the higher education of
women had lasted now for two generations, with satisfactory
results. He added that the degrees about to be
granted had been properly won, for they represent as hard
a training as the more vigorous young men receive, and he
concluded with a hope that some at least of the women
graduates might show themselves possessed of the creative
faculty, and add something to the world&rsquo;s stock of
knowledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t the Seniors to take any part? Isn&rsquo;t there a
valedictory or something of that kind?&rdquo; asked Edith of
her neighbor Nora, as a little pause followed the President&rsquo;s
address.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, that isn&rsquo;t the way. I suppose it&rsquo;s the only
college in the country where the class has no preparation
for Commencement.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_316">316</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s much the best way,&rdquo; said Mr. Blair, overhearing
what the girls said. &ldquo;A great deal of needless effort is
wasted on useless speeches for Commencement. It&rsquo;s as
fatiguing to the audience as to the Seniors themselves.
This way, it seems to me, is much best. It is so simple
and dignified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but some people are disappointed at not seeing
the class celebrities,&rdquo; responded Edith. &ldquo;Of course we
know something about Clarissa and Lois and Pamela and
the others who have distinguished themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to mention Julia,&rdquo; interposed Nora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, naturally; well, we know all these girls by sight,
but there must be many here who have never seen them,
and who would be very glad to know who&rsquo;s who.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they are all there; and if we listen, we may be
able to fit the right name to the right girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of all in that great audience, perhaps no one was more
disappointed than Angelina at the simplicity of the programme.
Julia had had a card of invitation sent her, and
she had come in a wonderful yellow hat covered with large
pink flowers, and a gown of the brightest pink gingham.
She had fully expected that Julia would be the centre of
interest, and she was really grieved that one who had been
so kind to her had not been given an opportunity at least
to sing or play something from the operetta. Besides, she
had a personal disappointment in the fact that she could
not present to Julia the immense bouquet that she had
brought with her from Shiloh. She had had the whole
scene planned. In the midst of a burst of applause she
would advance toward the stage, and, with a curtsy that
she had been practising, fling the bouquet at Julia&rsquo;s feet,
at the close of her performance, whatever it was. But
now Julia was no more conspicuous than the others of the
class. She had neither sung nor made an oration, and
Angelina herself had had no opportunity for a dramatic
appearance before the audience. Her curtsy had been
practised in vain; and Angelina, as she grasped the flowers,
looked decidedly woe-begone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_317">317</div>
<p>But at last the Seniors were passing in single file toward
the platform to receive their degrees, and each girl as her
name was called received the crimson-tied parchment
from the hands of the President. Before the Seniors
several Alumn&aelig; received their M.A. But the receiving
of the degrees in the presence of that great audience was
not unalloyed bliss. Even Lois and Pamela with <i>summa
cum</i>, and Clarissa and Julia and others with their <i>magnas</i>,
and Polly and Ruth with <i>cum laude</i>, felt a thrill of sadness
as they passed down the steps in front of the dignified
statue of Josiah Quincy.</p>
<p>Their undergraduate days were over!</p>
<p>That evening as Alumn&aelig; they were cordially welcomed
to an Alumn&aelig; dinner by the older graduates, and if they
felt uncomfortably warm wearing their long black gowns
over their white dresses, there were compensations; for
there was a satisfaction when Clarissa responded to one of
the toasts to hear her speech called the wittiest ever made
by a graduate, for Clarissa belonged to the whole class.
Then, too, some of Polly&rsquo;s songs were so enthusiastically
received that it was a delight to remember that two others
of the class, Julia the composer of the music and Ruth
who had written the words, shared the credit with the gay
singer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_318">318</div>
<p>At dusk the gay crowd wandered out on the lawn, where
the Glee Club sang, and old friends gathered in little
groups to talk over the happenings of the past year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a year <i>we</i> shall be old graduates,&rdquo; said Ruth with
a sigh; &ldquo;already I begin to feel the change. It seems as
if everything <i>has</i> been, as if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; interposed Julia, &ldquo;everything is to be.
Our undergraduate days are past, and yet I doubt that
any of us would really care to live them over again. We
can be thankful for what we have learned here, but after
all, the sooner we can take our places in the world, the
better. College life at the best is selfish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&mdash;there, Julia, don&rsquo;t preach! Look at Fay
House. It is almost picturesque.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they stood at the gate, the two girls turned and
gazed at the old building, whose outlines in the dusk
showed dimly through the screen of elms. Lights shone
from some of its upper windows, and it looked like a
stately palace.</p>
<p>This was undoubtedly the thought in Julia&rsquo;s mind as
she cried, turning away, &ldquo;Good-bye, Palace of Learning,&rdquo;
while Ruth added, &ldquo;Good-bye, great Class of
189&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truly, it <i>had</i> been a great class, but its undergraduate
days were over.</p>

<p>Illustrated by Frank T. Merrill. 12mo. $1.50</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Miss Ray&rsquo;s work draws instant comparison with the best of Miss Alcott&rsquo;s: first, because
she has the same genuine sympathy with boy and girl life; secondly, because she creates
real characters, individual and natural, like the young people one knows, actually working
out the same kind of problems; and, finally, because her style of writing is equally
unaffected and straightforward. She builds upon clearly thought-out convictions, and the
influence of the book will be wholly for good, tending toward a sane, wholesome view of
life generally. There is a deal of fun in it too.&mdash;<i>Christian Register</i>, Boston.</p>
